This topic describes how to deploy Ops Manager Director for Pivotal Container Service (PKS) on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

After you complete this procedure, follow the instructions in the [Configuring Ops Manager Director on GCP](./gcp-om-config.html) and [Configuring PKS on GCP](./installing-pks-gcp.html) topics.

## <a id='select-tgz'></a>Step 1: Locate the Pivotal Ops Manager Installation File ##

1. Log in to the [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf), and click on **Pivotal Cloud Foundry Operations Manager**.

1. From the **Releases** drop-down, select the release to install.

1. Select one of the following download files:
    * **Pivotal Cloud Foundry Ops Manager for GCP**
    * **Pivotal Cloud Foundry Ops Manager YAML for GCP**

    When you click on the download link, your browser downloads or opens the <code>OpsManager\_<i>version</i>\_onGCP.pdf</code> or <code>OpsManager\_<i>version</i>\_onGCP.yml</code> file. <br/><br/>
   These documents provide the GCP location of the Ops Manager `.tar.gz` installation file based on the geographic location of your installation.

1. Copy the filepath string of the Ops Manager image based on your deployment location.

## <a id="create-image"></a>Step 2: Create a Private VM Image

1. Log in to the [GCP Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).

1. In the left navigation panel, click **Compute Engine**, and select **Images**.

1. Click **Create Image**.

1. Complete the following fields:
  * **Name**: Enter a name. For example, `opsman-pcf-gcp-2-0`.
  * **Encryption**: Leave **Automatic (recommended)** selected.
  * **Source**: Choose **Cloud Storage file**.
  * **Cloud Storage file**: Paste in the Google Cloud Storage filepath you copied from the PDF file in the [previous step](#select-tgz). 
1. Click **Create**. The file may take a few minutes to import. 

## <a id="start-vm"></a>Step 3: Create the Ops Manager VM Instance

1. Select the checkbox for the image that you created above.

1. Click **Create Instance**.

1. In the **Create an instance form**, complete the following fields:
  * **Name**: Enter a name that matches the naming conventions of your deployment.
  * **Zone**: Choose a zone from the region in which you created your network.
  * **Machine type**: Choose `n1-standard-2`. 
    * Click **Customize** to manually configure the vCPU and memory. An Ops Manager VM instance requires the following minimum specifications:

        | **Machine Spec** | **Minimum Value** |
        |------------------|----------------------|
        |CPU |2&nbsp;vCPUs |
        |Memory| 8&nbsp;GB |
  * **Boot disk**: Click **Change**, then perform the following steps:
     * Click **Custom images** if it is not already selected. 
     * Select the **Boot disk type**. If you have an Ops Manager environment with high performance needs, select **SSD**. As an example, environments used to [develop PCF tiles](http://docs.pivotal.io/tiledev/) may benefit from a higher performing Ops Manager VM boot disk. For most environments, however, you can select **Standard**.
     * Set the **Size (GB)** of the boot disk to the minimum or higher.

            | **Machine Spec** | **Minimum Value** |
            |------------------|----------------------|
            |Boot disk|100&nbsp;GB|
     * Select the Ops Manager image you created in the previous step if it is not already selected.
     * Click **Select** to save.
  * Under **Identity and API access**, choose the **Service account** you created when preparing your environment during the step [Set up an IAM Service Account](./gcp-prepare-env.html#iam-account). 
  * **Allow HTTP traffic**: Leave this checkbox unselected.  
  * **Allow HTTPS traffic**: Leave this checkbox unselected. 
  * **Networking**: Select the **Networking** tab, and perform the following steps:
     * Under **Network interfaces**, perform the following steps:
        * Remove the `default` network interface if this interface still exists.
        * Select the network (for example, `MY-PKS-virt-network`) you created when preparing your environment in the [Create a GCP Network with Subnet](./gcp-prepare-env.html#create-network) section of the _Preparing to Deploy PKS on GCP_ topic. 
        * Under **Subnetwork**, select the `MY-PKS-subnet-infrastructure-MY-GCP-REGION` subnet that you created when preparing your environment in the [Create a GCP Network with Subnet](./gcp-prepare-env.html#create-network) section of the _Preparing to Deploy PKS on GCP_ topic. 
        * For **Primary internal IP**, select **Ephemeral (Custom)**. Enter an IP address (for example, `192.168.101.5`) in the **Custom ephemeral IP address** field. Specify the next available internal IP address located within the reserved IP range that you will [configure in Ops Manager Director](./gcp-om-config.html#network). Do not use the **Gateway IP**, for example `192.168.101.1`.
        * For **External IP**, select **Create IP address**. In the next form, enter a name for the static IP. For example, `om-public-ip`. Click **Reserve**. In the **External IP** drop-down, select the static IP address you just reserved.
     * For **Network tags**, enter `MY-PKS-opsman`, `allow-https`, and `allow-ssh`. These tags tag apply the firewall rules you created in [Create Firewall Rules for the Network](gcp-prepare-env.html#firewall-rules) to the Ops Manager VM.
    
1. Click **Create** to deploy the new Ops Manager VM. This may take a few moments.

1. Navigate to your DNS provider, and create an entry that points a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) `opsman.MY-DOMAIN` to the `om-public-ip` external static IP address of Ops Manager that you created in a previous step. 

   <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: In order to set up Ops Manager authentication correctly, Pivotal recommends using a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) to access Ops Manager. Using an ephemeral IP address to access Ops Manager can cause authentication errors upon subsequent access.</p>
