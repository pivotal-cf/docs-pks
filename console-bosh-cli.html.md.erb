owner: PKS

After you deploy <%= vars.product_short %> from <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console, you can use the BOSH CLI from both the appliance VM and the Ops Manager VM.

## <a id='bosh-cli-appliance'></a>Using the BOSH CLI from the <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console Appliance VM  

You can use the BOSH CLI from the <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console appliance VM.

1. In <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console, go to the **Deployment Metadata** view.
1. Expand the row for **BOSH CLI invocation from console appliance**.
1. Click the clipboard icon at the end of the row to copy the BOSH CLI invocation information.
1. Connect to the management console appliance VM by using SSH.<br>
   ```ssh <console_vm_address>```
1. Export the value that you copied from Deployment Metadata view to use BOSH CLI from the management console appliance VM.<br>
   ```export <bosh_cli_invocation_value>```

## <a id='bosh-ssh'></a>Using BOSH SSH

The management console appliance does not support the use of the `bosh ssh` command to connect to the BOSH VM from the appliance VM. To connect to the BOSH VM by using `bosh ssh`, you must use the BOSH CLI from the Ops Manager VM.

1. In <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console, go to the **Deployment Metadata** view.
1. Expand the row for **BOSH CLI invocation from Ops Manager**.
1. Click the clipboard icon at the end of the row to copy the BOSH CLI invocation command.
1. Connect to the Ops Manager VM by using SSH.

    For information about how to connect to the Ops Manager VM, see [Connect to Operations Manager with SSH](console-login-opsmanager.html#ops-manager-ssh).
1.  Export the value that you copied from Deployment Metadata view to use BOSH CLI from Ops Manager.<br>
   ```export <bosh_cli_invocation_value>```
