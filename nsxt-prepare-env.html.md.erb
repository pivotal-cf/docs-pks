<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

Before you install <%= vars.product_full %> on vSphere with NSX-T integration, you must prepare your NSX-T environment. Complete all of the steps listed in the order presented to manually create the NSX-T environment for <%= vars.product_short %>.

##<a id='plan'></a> Step 1: Plan Network Topology, Subnets, and IP Blocks

###<a id='plan-topology'></a>Plan NSX-T Deployment Topology

Review [vSphere with NSX-T Version Requirements](vsphere-nsxt-requirements.html)
and [Hardware Requirements for <%= vars.product_short %> on vSphere with NSX-T](vsphere-nsxt-rpd-mpd.html).

Review the [Deployment Toplogies](nsxt-topologies.html) for <%= vars.product_short %> on vSphere with NSX-T, and the [NSX-T Data Center documentation] (https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center/2.4/installation/GUID-10B1A61D-4DF2-481E-A93E-C694726393F9.html) to ensure that your chosen network topology will enable the following communications:

* vCenter, NSX-T components, and ESXi hosts must be able to communicate with each other.
* The BOSH Director VM must be able to communicate with vCenter and the NSX Manager.
* The BOSH Director VM must be able to communicate with all nodes in all Kubernetes clusters.
* Each <%= vars.product_short %>-provisioned Kubernetes cluster deploys the NSX-T Node Agent and the Kube Proxy that run as BOSH-managed processes on each worker node.

In addition, the NSX-T Container Plugin (NCP) runs as a BOSH-managed process on the Kubernetes master node. In a multi-master <%= vars.product_short %> deployment, the NCP process runs on all master nodes. However, the process is active only on one master node. If the NCP process on an active master is unresponsive, BOSH activates another NCP process. Refer to the [NCP documentation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center/2.4/com.vmware.nsxt.ncp_kubernetes.doc/GUID-FB641321-319D-41DC-9D16-37D6BA0BC0DE.html) for more information.

###<a id='plan-cidrs'></a>Plan Network CIDRs

Before you install <%= vars.product_short %> on vSphere with NSX-T, you should plan for the CIDRs and IP blocks that you are using in your deployment.

Plan for the following network CIDRs in the IPv4 address space according to the instructions in the VMware [NSX-T documentation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T/index.html).

* **VTEP CIDRs**: One or more of these networks host your GENEVE Tunnel Endpoints on your NSX Transport Nodes. Size the networks to support all of your expected Host and Edge Transport Nodes. For example, a CIDR of `192.168.1.0/24` provides 254 usable IPs.

* **PKS MANAGEMENT CIDR**: This small network is used to access <%= vars.product_short %> management components such as Ops Manager, BOSH Director, the PKS Service VM, and the Harbor Registry VM (if deployed). For example, a CIDR of `10.172.1.0/28` provides 14 usable IPs. For the [No-NAT deployment topologies](nsxt-topologies.html#topology-no-nat-virtual-switch), this is a corporate routable subnet /28. For the [NAT deployment topology](nsxt-topologies.html#topology-nat), this is a non-routable subnet /28, and DNAT needs to be configured in NSX-T to access the <%= vars.product_short %> management components.

* **PKS LB CIDR**: This network provides your load balancing address space for each Kubernetes cluster created by <%= vars.product_short %>. The network also provides IP addresses for Kubernetes API access and Kubernetes exposed services. For example, `10.172.2.0/24` provides 256 usable IPs. This network is used when creating the `ip-pool-vips` described in [Creating NSX-T Objects for <%= vars.product_short %>](nsxt-create-objects.html), or when the services are deployed. You enter this network in the
**Floating IP Pool ID** field in the **Networking** pane of the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile.

###<a id='plan-ip-blocks'></a>Plan IP Blocks

When you install <%= vars.product_short %> on NSX-T, you are required to specify the **Pods IP Block ID** and **Nodes IP Block ID** in the **Networking** pane of the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile. These IDs map to the two IP blocks you must configure in NSX-T: the Pods IP Block for Kubernetes pods, and the Node IP Block for Kubernetes nodes (VMs). For more information, see the [Networking](installing-nsx-t.html#networking) section of _Installing <%= vars.product_short %> on vSphere with NSX-T Integration_.

  <img src="images/nsxt/nsxt-ip-blocks.png" alt="Required IP Blocks for NSX-T">

####<a id='pods-ip-block'></a>Pods IP Block

Each time a Kubernetes namespace is created, a subnet from the **Pods IP Block** is allocated. The subnet size carved out from this block is /24, which means a maximum of 256 pods can be created per namespace. When a Kubernetes cluster is deployed by <%= vars.product_short %>, by default 3 namespaces are created. Often additional namespaces will be created by operators to facilitate cluster use. As a result, when creating the **Pods IP Block**, you must use a CIDR range larger than /24 to ensure that NSX has enough IP addresses to allocate for all pods. The recommended size is /16. For more information, see [Creating NSX-T Objects for <%= vars.product_short %>](nsxt-create-objects.html).

  <img src="images/nsxt/pods-ip-block.png" alt="Pods IP Block">

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: By default, <strong>Pods IP Block</strong> is a block of non-routable, private IP addresses.
After you deploy <%= vars.product_short %>, you can define a network profile that specifies a routable IP block for your pods.
The routable IP block overrides the default non-routable <strong>Pods IP Block</strong> when a Kubernetes cluster is deployed using that network profile. For more information, see <a href="network-profiles.html#routable-pods">Routable Pods</a> in <em>Using Network Profiles (NSX-T Only)</em>.</p>

####<a id='nodes-ip-block'></a>Nodes IP Block

The **Nodes IP Block** is used by <%= vars.product_short %> to assign address space to Kubernetes nodes when new clusters are deployed or a cluster increases its scale. By default, each Kubernetes cluster deployed by <%= vars.product_short %> is allocated a /24 subnet, which allows up to 256 IP addresses.

To deploy multiple Kubernetes clusters, you have two options: define an NSX-T network that is larger than /24, such as /16, or define a [network profile](./network-profiles-define.html) and customize the Nodes network to allocate less address space, such as /27.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: You can use a smaller nodes block size for no-NAT environments with a limited number of routable subnets.
For example, /20 allows up to 16 Kubernetes clusters to be created.</p>

For more information, see [Creating NSX-T Objects for <%= vars.product_short %>](nsxt-create-objects.html).

  <img src="images/nsxt/nodes-ip-block.png" alt="Nodes IP Block">

###<a id='reserved-ip-blocks'></a>Reserved IP Blocks

The <%= vars.product_short %> Management Plane must not use the use 172.17.0.0/16 subnet. This restriction applies to all virtual machines (VMs) deployed during the <%= vars.product_short %> installation process, including the PKS control plane, Ops Manager, BOSH Director, and Harbor Registry.

In addition, do not use any of the IP blocks listed below for Kubernetes master or worker node VMs, or for Kubernetes pods.
If you create Kubernetes clusters with any of the blocks listed below, the Kubernetes worker nodes cannot reach Harbor or internal Kubernetes services.

The Docker daemon on the Kubernetes worker node uses the subnet in the following CIDR range.
Do not use IP addresses in the following CIDR range:

  * 172.17.0.1/16
  * 172.18.0.1/16
  * 172.19.0.1/16
  * 172.20.0.1/16
  * 172.21.0.1/16
  * 172.22.0.1/16

If <%= vars.product_short %> is deployed with Harbor, Harbor uses the following CIDR ranges for its internal Docker bridges.
Do not use IP addresses in the following CIDR range:

  * 172.18.0.0/16
  * 172.19.0.0/16
  * 172.20.0.0/16
  * 172.21.0.0/16
  * 172.22.0.0/16

Each Kubernetes cluster uses the following subnet for Kubernetes services.
Do not use the following IP block for the Nodes IP Block:

  * 10.100.200.0/24

##<a id='nsx-manager'></a> Step 2: Deploy NSX Manager

Deploy the [NSX Manager Unified Appliance](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center/2.3/com.vmware.nsxt.install.doc/GUID-6788EC72-9562-45AD-AD94-7D883B90DE69.html). For instructions, see [Deploy the NSX Manager](nsxt-deploy.html#deploy-nsx-manager).

##<a id='nsx-controllers'></a> Step 3: Deploy NSX Controllers

Deploy one or more [NSX Controllers](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center/2.3/com.vmware.nsxt.install.doc/GUID-91955EED-05C4-4BED-88C3-FB5ED7420BAE.html). You must deploy at least one NSX Controller for <%= vars.product_short %>; three NSX Controllers are recommended. For instructions, see [Deploy NSX Controllers](nsxt-deploy.html#deploy-nsx-controllers).

##<a id='nsx-clusters'></a> Step 4: Create NSX Clusters

Create NSX Clusters for the [Management Plane](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center/2.3/com.vmware.nsxt.install.doc/GUID-08A4954C-67E7-4DB9-BF4C-B90969923E73.html) and [Control Plane](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center/2.3/com.vmware.nsxt.install.doc/GUID-FAC5A685-D876-4FAA-A209-CBF797F34DC7.html). For instructions, see [Create NSX Clusters](nsxt-deploy.html#create-nsx-cluster).

##<a id='nsx-edges'></a> Step 5: Deploy NSX Edge Nodes

Deploy two or more [NSX Edge Nodes](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center/2.3/com.vmware.nsxt.install.doc/GUID-6E035C20-35B4-415F-A0B9-20C4A5674B46.html). Edge Nodes for <%= vars.product_short %> run load balancers for PKS API traffic, load balancer services for Kubenetes pods, and ingress controllers for Kubernetes pods. For instructions, see [Deploy NSX Edge Nodes](nsxt-deploy.html#deploy-nsx-edges).

<%= vars.product_short %> supports active/standby Edge Node failover and requires at least two Edge Nodes. In addition, <%= vars.product_short %> requires the Edge Node Large VM (8 vCPU, 16 GB of RAM, and 120 GB of storage). The default size of the LB provisioned for <%= vars.product_short %> is small. You can customize this after deploying <%= vars.product_short %> using <a href="network-profiles.html">Network Profiles</a>.

The table below lists the maximum number of load balancers per Edge Node form factor.

Edge Node Type  | LB Small Max  | LB Medium Max | LB Large Max | Supported by <%= vars.product_short %>
----------------|---------------|---------------|--------------|-----------------
Edge VM Small   | 0             | 0             | 0        | No
Edge VM Medium  | 1             | 0             | 0        | No
Edge VM Large   | 40            | 4             | 0        | Yes
Edge Bare Metal | 750           | 100           | 7        | Yes

Keep in mind the following requirements for NSX Edge Nodes with <%= vars.product_short %>:

* <%= vars.product_short %> requires the NSX-T Edge Node large VM (8 vCPU and 16 GB of RAM) or the bare metal Edge Node. For more information, see <a href="./vsphere-nsxt-rpd-mpd.html">Hardware requirements for <%= vars.product_short %> on vSphere with NSX-T</a>.
* The default load balancer deployed by NSX-T for an <%= vars.product_short %>-provisioned Kubernetes cluster is the small load balancer. The size of the load balancer can be customized using <a href="./network-profiles-define.html">Network Profiles</a>.
* Edge Node VMs can only be deployed on Intel-based ESXi hosts.
* The large load balancer requires a bare metal Edge Node.
* For high-availability Edge Nodes are deployed as pairs within an Edge Cluster. The minimum number of Edge Nodes per Edge Cluster is 2; the maximum is 10. <%= vars.product_short %> supports active/standby mode only. In standby mode, the standby LB is not available for use while the active LB is active. To determine the maximum number of load balancers per Edge Cluster, multiply the maximum number of LBs for the Edge Node type by the number of Edge Nodes and divide by 2. For example, with 10 Edge VM Large nodes in an Edge Cluster, you can have up to 200 small LB instances (40 x 10 / 2), or up to 20 medium LB instances (4 x 10 / 2).
* <%= vars.product_short %> deploys a virtual server for each load balancer instance. For service of type load balancer, it is one virtual server per service. There are two global virtual servers deployed for ingress resources (HTTP and HTTPS). And there is one global virtual server for the PKS API. For more information, see <a href="network-profiles-define.html">Defining Network Profiles</a>.

##<a id='nsx-edge-reg'></a> Step 6: Register NSX Edge Nodes

[Register NSX Edge Nodes](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center/2.3/com.vmware.nsxt.install.doc/GUID-11BB4CF9-BC1D-4A76-A32A-AD4C98CBF25B.html) with the NSX Manager. For instructions, see [Register NSX Edge Nodes](nsxt-deploy.html#register-nsx-edges).

##<a id='nsx-vib'></a> Step 7: Enable VIB Repository Service

The VIB repository service provides access to native libraries for NSX Transport Nodes. VIB must be enabled before you proceed further with deploying NSX. For instructions, see [Enable VIB Repository Service on NSX Manager](nsxt-deploy.html#enable-repo).

##<a id='nsx-tep'></a> Step 8: Create TEP IP Pool

Create Tunnel Endpoint IP Pool (TEP IP Pool) within the usable range of the **VTEP CIDR** that was defined in [preparation for installing NSX-T)(#plan-cidrs). The TEP IP Pool is used for [NSX Transport Nodes](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center/2.3/com.vmware.nsxt.install.doc/GUID-370D06E1-1BB6-4144-A654-7AF2542C3136.html?hWord=N4IghgNiBcICoFEAKACAcgZQBoFo4gF8g). For instructions, see [Create TEP IP Pool](nsxt-deploy.html#create-tep).

##<a id='nsx-overlay'></a> Step 9: Create Overlay Transport Zone

Create an [NSX Overlay Transport Zone](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center/2.3/com.vmware.nsxt.install.doc/GUID-AC4A0159-DF37-47F6-A333-33C7945570D1.html) (TZ-Overlay) for <%= vars.product_short %> Control Plane services and Kubernetes Cluster deployment overlay networks. For instructions, see [Create Overlay TZ](nsxt-deploy.html#create-tz-overlay).

##<a id='nsx-vlan'></a> Step 10: Create VLAN Transport Zone

Create an [NSX VLAN Transport Zone](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center/2.3/com.vmware.nsxt.install.doc/GUID-AC4A0159-DF37-47F6-A333-33C7945570D1.html) (TZ-VLAN) for NSX Edge uplinks (ingress/egress) for <%= vars.product_short %>-managed Kubernetes clusters. For instructions, see [Create VLAN TZ](nsxt-deploy.html#create-tz-vlan).

##<a id='nsx-uplink'></a> Step 11: Create Uplink Profile for Edge Nodes

Create an [NSX Uplink Profile](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center/2.4/installation/GUID-50FDFDFB-F660-4269-9503-39AE2BBA95B4.html) for NSX Edge Nodes to be used with <%= vars.product_short %>. For instructions, see [Create Uplink Profile for Edge Nodes](nsxt-deploy.html#create-uplink).

##<a id='nsx-tn'></a> Step 12: Create Transport Edge Nodes

Create [NSX Edge Transport Nodes](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center/2.4/installation/GUID-53295329-F02F-44D7-A6E0-2E3A9FAE6CF9.html), which allow Edge Nodes to exchange traffic for virtual networks among other NSX nodes. For instructions, see [Create Transport Edge Nodes](nsxt-deploy.html#create-edge-tns).

##<a id='nsx-edge-cluster'></a> Step 13: Create Edge Cluster

Create an [NSX Edge Cluster](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center/2.4/installation/GUID-898099FC-4ED2-4553-809D-B81B494B67E7.html) and add each NSX Edge Transport Node to the Edge Cluster. For instructions, see [Create Edge Cluster](nsxt-deploy.html#create-edge-cluster).

##<a id='nsx-to'></a> Step 14: Create T0 Logical Router for <%= vars.product_short %>

[NSX Tier-0 Logical Routers](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center/2.4/administration/GUID-3F163DEE-1EE6-4D80-BEBF-8D109FDB577C.html) are used to route data between the NSX-T virtual network and the physical network. For instructions, see [Create T0 Router](nsxt-deploy.html#create-t0-router).

##<a id='nsx-edge-ha'></a> Step 15: Configure NSX Edge for High Availability (HA)

Configure NSX Edge for high availability (HA) using Active/Standby mode to support failover, as shown in the following figure. For instructions, see [Configure Edge HA](nsxt-deploy.html#configure-edge-ha).

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If the T0 Router is not configured for HA as decribed in <a href="nsxt-deploy.html#create-edge-ha">Configure Edge Nodes for HA</a>, failover to the standby Edge Node will not occur.</p>

![NSX Edge High Availability](images/vsphere/nsxt-edge-ha.png)

##<a id='nsx-esxi'></a> Step 16: Prepare ESXi Hosts for <%= vars.product_short %> Compute Plane

An [NSX Transport Node](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center/2.3/com.vmware.nsxt.install.doc/GUID-FCC5390E-3489-47E8-ABE6-2F7FD43775BD.html) allows NSX Nodes to exchange traffic for virtual networks. ESXi hosts dedicated to the <%= vars.product_short %> Compute Cluster must be prepared as transport nodes. For instructions, see [Prepare Compute Cluster ESXi Hosts](nsxt-deploy.html#prepare-esxi).

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The Transport Nodes must be placed on free host NICs not already used by other vSwitches on the ESXi host. Use the <code>VTEPS</code> IP pool that allows ESXi hosts to route and communicate with each other, as well as other Edge Transport Nodes.</p>

##<a id='nsx-esxi'></a> Step 17: Create NSX-T Objects for <%= vars.product_short %> Management Plane

Prepare the vSphere and NSX-T infrastructure for the <%= vars.product_short %> Management Plane where the PKS, Ops Manager, BOSH Director, and Harbor Registry VMs are deployed. This includes a vSphere resource pool for <%= vars.product_short %> management components, an NSX [Tier-1 (T1) Logical Switch](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center/2.4/administration/GUID-23194F9A-416A-40EA-B9F7-346B391C3EF8.html), and an NSX [Tier-1 Logical Router and Port](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center/2.4/administration/GUID-DAEF8457-8363-4F33-84DA-68AA36A2DE3C.html). For instructions, see [Prepare <%= vars.product_short %> Management Plane](nsxt-prepare-mgmt-plane.html).

If you are using the <a href="nsxt-topologies.html#topology-nat">NAT Topology</a>, create the following NAT rules on the T0 Router. For instructions, see [Prepare Management Plane](nsxt-prepare-mgmt-plane.html).

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Type</th>
    <th>For</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>DNAT</td>
    <td>External > Ops Manager</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>DNAT</td>
    <td>External > Harbor (optional)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>SNAT</td>
    <td>PKS Management Plane > vCenter and NSX-T Manager</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>SNAT</td>
    <td>PKS Management Plane > DNS</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>SNAT</td>
    <td>PKS Management Plane > NTP</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>SNAT</td>
    <td>PKS Management Plane > LDAP/AD (optional)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>SNAT</td>
    <td>PKS Management Plane > ESXi</td>
  </tr>
</table>

##<a id='nsx-comp-plane'></a> Step 18: Create NSX-T Objects for <%= vars.product_short %> Compute Plane

Create Resource Pools for AZ-1 and AZ-2, which map to the Availability Zones you will create when you configure BOSH Director and reference when you install the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile. In addition, create SNAT rules on the T0 router:

- One for K8s Master Nodes (hosting NCP) to reach the NSX-T Manager
- One for Kubernetes Master Node Access to LDAP/AD (optional)

For instructions, see [Prepare Compute Plane](nsxt-prepare-compute-plane.html).

##<a id='nsx-om'></a> Step 19: Deploy Ops Manager in the NSX-T Environment

Deploy Ops Manager v2.4.2+, v2.5.x or v2.6.x on the NSX-T Management Plane network.
For instructions, see <a href="vsphere-nsxt-om-deploy.html">Deploy Ops Manager on vSphere with NSX-T</a>.

##<a id='nsx-mgr-cert'></a> Step 20: Generate NSX Manager Certificate

Generate the CA Cert for the NSX Manager and import the certificate to NSX Manager.
For instructions, see <a href="generate-nsx-ca-cert.html">Generate the NSX Manager CA Cert</a>.

##<a id='nsx-bosh'></a> Step 21: Configure BOSH Director for vSphere with NSX-T

Create BOSH availability zones (AZs) that map to the Management and Compute resource pools in vSphere, and the Management and Control plane networks in NSX-T.
For instructions, see <a href="vsphere-nsxt-om-config.html">Configure BOSH Director for vSphere with NSX-T</a>.

##<a id='nsx-pi-cert'></a> Step 22: Generate NSX Manager Principal Identity Certificate

Generate the NSX Manager Super User Principal Identity Certificate and register it with the NSX Manager using the NSX API.
For instructions, see <a href="generate-nsx-pi-cert.html">Generate the NSX Manager PI Cert</a>.

##<a id='nsx-pks-obj'></a> Step 23: Create NSX-T Objects for <%= vars.product_short %>

Create IP blocks for the [node networks](#nodes-ip-block) and the [pod networks](#pods-ip-block). The subnets for both nodes and pods should have a size of 256 (/16). See [Plan IP Blocks](#plan-ip-blocks) and [Reserved IP Blocks](#reserved-ip-blocks) for details.

In addition, create a [Floating IP Pool](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center/2.4/administration/GUID-A27DF20A-5162-40F5-B7D5-2DF8B6AE5DBE.html) from which to assign routable IP addresses to components. This network provides your load balancing address space for each Kubernetes cluster created by <%= vars.product_short %>. The network also provides IP addresses for Kubernetes API access and Kubernetes exposed services.

These network objects are required to configure the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile for NSX-T networking. For instructions, see <a href="./nsxt-create-objects.html">Create NSXT Object for <%= vars.product_short %></a>.

##<a id='nsx-pks-install'></a> Step 24: Install <%= vars.product_short %> on vSphere with NSX-T

At this point your NSX-T environment is prepared for <%= vars.product_short %> installation using the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile in Ops Manager. For instructions, see <a href="./installing-nsx-t.html">Installing <%= vars.product_short %> on vSphere with NSX-T</a>.

##<a id='nsx-pks-harbor'></a> Step 25: Install Harbor Harbor Registry for <%= vars.product_short %>

The VMware Harbor Registry is recommended for <%= vars.product_short %>. Install Harbor in the NSX Management Plane with other <%= vars.product_short %> components (PKS API, Ops Manager, and BOSH). For instructions, see <a href="https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Enterprise-PKS/1.4/vmware-harbor-registry/GUID-index.html">Installing Harbor Registry on vSphere with NSX-T</a> in the VMware Harbor documentation.

If you are using the [NAT deployment topology](nsxt-topologies.html#topology-nat) for <%= vars.product_short %>, create a DNAT rule that maps the private Harbor IP address to a routable IP address from the floating IP pool on the PKS management network. See <a href="https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Enterprise-PKS/1.4/vmware-harbor-registry/GUID-integrating-pks.html">Create DNAT Rule</a>.

##<a id='nsx-pks-adv'></a> Step 26: Perform Post-Installation NSX-T Configurations as Necessary

Once <%= vars.product_short %> is installed, you may want to perform additional NSX-T configurations to support customization of Kubernetes clusters at deployment time, such as:

- <a href="./proxies.html">Configuring an HTTP Proxy</a> to proxy outgoing HTTP/S traffic from NCP, PKS, BOSH, and Ops Manager to vSphere infrastructure components (vCenter, NSX Manager)
- <a href="./network-profiles-define.html">Defining Network Profiles</a> to customize NSX-T networking objects, such as load balancer size, custom Pods IP Block, routable Pods IP Block, configurable CIDR range for the Pods IP Block, custom Floating IP block, and more.
- <a href="./nsxt-multi-t0.html">Configuring Multiple Tier-0 Routers</a> to support customer/tenant isolation
