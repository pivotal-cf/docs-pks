You can use VMware <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console on vSphere to update some of the components of your deployment individually when a new minor version of those components is available.

1. In <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console, go to **Configuration** &gt; **<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Component Patch** to view the list of components that are ready for patching. 
1. Obtain the patch installers. 
  - In air-gapped environments, download the patch installer from https://downloads.vmware.com/ to a local location. Click the **Import Patch** button to upload the installer to the management console.
  - In environments with access to the internet, click the **Download** button next to the relevant components to import the patch installers directly.
