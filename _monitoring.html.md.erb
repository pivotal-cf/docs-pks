You can monitor Kubernetes clusters and pods metrics externally using the integration with <a href="https://docs.wavefront.com">Wavefront by VMware</a>.<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Before you configure Wavefront integration, you must have an active Wavefront account and access to a Wavefront instance. You provide your Wavefront access token during configuration and enabling errands. For additional information, see <a href="https://docs.wavefront.com/integrations_pks.html">Pivotal Container Service Integration Details</a> in the Wavefront documentation.</p>

By default, monitoring is disabled. To enable and configure Wavefront monitoring, do the following:

1. Under **Wavefront Integration**, select **Yes**.<br>

1. Under **Wavefront URL**, enter the URL of your Wavefront subscription. For example, `https://try.wavefront.com/api`.
1. Under **Wavefront Access Token**, enter the API token for your Wavefront subscription.
1. To configure Wavefront to send alerts by email, enter email addresses or Wavefront Target IDs separated by commas under **Wavefront Alert Recipient**. For example, `user@example.com,Wavefront_TargetID`. To create alerts, you must enable errands.
1. In the **Errands** tab, enable **Create pre-defined Wavefront alerts errand** and **Delete pre-defined Wavefront alerts errand**.
