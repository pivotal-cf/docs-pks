This topic provides instructions for deploying Ops Manager on VMware vSphere with NSX-T integration for use with <%= vars.product_full %>.

##<a id='prerequisites'></a>Prerequisites

Before deploying Ops Manager with NSX-T for <%= vars.product_short %>, you must have completed the following tasks:

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="./vsphere-nsxt-index-prepare.html">Preparing to Install <%= vars.product_short %> on vSphere with NSX-T Data Center</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="./vsphere-nsxt-rpd-mpd.html">Installing and Configuring NSX-T for <%= vars.product_short %></a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="./nsxt-prepare-mgmt-plane.html">Creating the <%= vars.product_short %> Management Plane</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="./nsxt-prepare-compute-plane.html">Create <%= vars.product_short %> Compute Plane</a>
  </li>
</ul>

In addition, review the supported Ops Manager versions for <%= vars.product_short %>. See [<%= vars.product_short %> Release Notes](release-notes.html) or the [Product Compatibility Matrix](https://docs.pivotal.io/resources/product-compatibility-matrix.pdf).

Review to the known issues for your version of Ops Manager. See one of the following:

* [PCF Ops Manager Release v2.5 Release Notes](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-5/pcf-release-notes/opsmanager-rn.html)
* [PCF Ops Manager Release v2.6 Release Notes](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-6/pcf-release-notes/opsmanager-rn.html)

##<a id='ssh-key'></a>SSH Key Requirements for Ops Manager v2.6

Beginning with Ops Manager v2.6 for vSphere, password authentication is replaced with SSL/TLS authentication. If you are installing Ops Manager v2.6 on vSphere, you cannot deploy Ops Manager successfully without adding a public SSH key in the appropriate field of the **Customize Template** screen. If you do not add a public SSH key, Ops Manager shuts down automatically because it cannot find a key and may enter a reboot loop. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-6/pcf-release-notes/breaking-changes.html#ssh-private-key">Passwords Not Supported for Ops Manager VM on vSphere</a> in the Ops Manager v2.6 release notes. For installation instructions specific to Ops Manager v2.6, see <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/ops-manager/2-6/vsphere/deploy.html#deploy">Deploy Ops Manager</a> in _Deploying Ops Manager on vSphere_.

When you add the key value to the **Public SSH Key** field, you must enter the entire public key similar to the format required for `authorized_keys`. For example, the format required is similar to the following:

```
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABJQAAAQEAnZBapWsER/EO1hLYvV/rkZe78mUBueZGHx1kw+ByfNbLoA385Cm72L+6qq40yOIH6R42nHN/bynbeHOD4Ptes4/s2lrLJtTzEWgH9XYnId4sE5f+QTFd2kRtTzZcu8WvFudEIyCIWjO+o9yvPETs05dEl/3KDn+t9uXxiszrG9Ycb2uNNpmDES+ohm9BQQFmpwFnao+UuQbRXLCcQ3SoE3Ai5Z9O+3PBwm0IByx87/dUuqvVISAJ8yGu2hJobx9PPStFERtUsfx5x+WIu9XIkrl5tzxgH9hBDsOS9cVUYJ7kKUUf1yyro6ocHyu6TWHJHSJLt8Z2FULxMPpqdn+8Xw== my-key
```

    <p class="note"><strong>WARNING</strong>: With VMware vCenter Server 6.5, when initially deploying the Ops Manager OVA, you cannot connect to an NSX-T logical switch. You must first connect to a vSphere Standard (vSS) or vSphere Distributed Switch (vDS). After the OVA deployment is complete, before powering on the Ops Manager VM, connect the network interface to the NSX-T logical switch. The instructions below describe how to do this. This issue is resolved in VMware vCenter Server 6.7. For more information about this issue, see the <a href="https://kb.vmware.com/kb/54142">VMware Knowledge Base</a>.</p>

1. At the **Customize template** screen, enter the following information, and click **Next**.
   * **IP Address**: The IP address of the Ops Manager network interface, for example `10.0.0.2` (assuming non-routable NAT-mode).
   * **Netmask**: The network mask for Ops Manager, for example, `255.255.255.0`.
   * **Default Gateway**: The default gateway for Ops Manager to use, for example `10.0.0.1` (assuming non-routable NAT-mode).
   * **DNS**: One or more DNS servers for the Ops Manager VM to use, for example `10.14.7.1`.
   * **NTP Servers**: The IP address of one or more NTP servers for Ops Manager, for example `10.113.60.176`.   
   * **Admin Password**: (Required for Ops Manager v2.5.) A default password for the "ubuntu" user. If you do not enter a password, Ops Manager will not boot up.
   * **Public SSH Key**: (Required for Ops Manager v2.6.) Enter the public SSH key to allow SSH access to the Ops Manager VM. You must enter the entire the public SSH key in the expected format. See <a href="./vsphere-nsxt-om-deploy.html#ssh-key">SSH Key Requirements for Ops Manager v2.6</a>.
   * **Custom hostname**: The hostname for the Ops Manager VM, for example `ops-manager`.
    <%= image_tag("images/nsxt/nsxt-data-center-installation/om26/om-install-06.png") %>
    <%= image_tag("images/nsxt/nsxt-data-center-installation/om26/om-install-07.png") %>    

1. At the **Ready to complete** screen, review the configuration settings and click **Finish**. This action begins the OVA import and deployment process.
    <%= image_tag("images/nsxt/nsxt-data-center-installation/om26/om-install-08.png") %>

## <a id="config-om"></a>Configure Ops Manager for <%= vars.product_short %>

The first time that you start Ops Manager, you must select an authentication system. These instructions use <strong>Internal Authentication</strong>. See [Set Up Ops Manager Authentication](https://docs.pivotal.io/ops-manager/2-6/vsphere/config.html#set-up) in _Configuring BOSH Director on vSphere_ in the PCF documentation for configuration details for the <strong>SAML</strong> and <strong>LDAP</strong> options.

1. If you are using the <a href="nsxt-topologies.html#topology-nat">NAT deployment topology</a>, create a DNAT rule that maps the Ops Manager private IP to a routable IP. See <a href="./nsxt-prepare-mgmt-plane.html">Create <%= vars.product_short %> Management Plane</a> for instructions.</p>

1. If you are using the <a href="nsxt-topologies.html">No-NAT deployment topology</a>, create a DNS entry for the routable IP address that you set for Ops Manager. Use FQDN to log into Ops Manager. 
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Ops Manager security features require you to create a fully qualified domain name to access Ops Manager. See <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-6/customizing/vsphere.html#paas">Installing Pivotal Cloud Foundry on vSphere</a>.</p>

1. Navigate to the IP address (NAT mode) or FQDN (No-NAT mode) of your Ops Manager VM in a web browser. The "Welcome to Ops Manager" page should appear.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: It is normal to experience a brief delay before the interface is accessible while the web server and VM start up.</p>
  <%= image_tag("images/nsxt/nsxt-data-center-installation/om26/om-install-10.png") %>    

1. Select **Internal Authentication** and provide the following information:
   * **Username**, **Password**, and **Password confirmation** to create a user with administrative privileges.
   * **Decryption passphrase** and the **Decryption passphrase confirmation**. This passphrase encrypts the Ops Manager datastore, and is not recoverable.
   * **HTTP proxy** or **HTTPS proxy**, follow the instructions in [Configuring Proxy Settings for the BOSH CPI](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-6/customizing/pcf-director-proxy-settings.html).

1. Read the **End User License Agreement**, and select the checkbox to accept the terms.

1. Click **Setup Authentication**. It takes a few minutes to initialize the database.
     <%= image_tag("images/nsxt/om/deploy-om-19.png") %>

1. Log in to Ops Manager with the username and password that you created.
     <%= image_tag("images/nsxt/om/deploy-om-20.png") %>

1. Verify success. You should be able to log in, and you should see the BOSH Director tile is present and ready for configuration, indicated by the orange color.
    <%= image_tag("images/nsxt/nsxt-data-center-installation/om26/om-install-11.png") %>
