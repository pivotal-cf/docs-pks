<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic provides instructions for installing the NSX Manager VM on vSphere for use with <%= vars.product_short %>.

##<a id='prereqs'></a> Prerequisites

Make sure you have completed the [Prerequisites for Installing NSX-T for <%= vars.product_short %>](./nsxt-install-prereqs.html).

##<a id='nsx-mgr-about'></a> About the NSX Manager Appliance

The NSX-T Manager VM is provided as an OVA file named the **NSX Unified Appliance** that you import into your vSphere environment and configure. 

For more information, see [Install the NSX Manager Unified Appliance](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center/2.4/installation/GUID-FA0ABBBD-34D8-4DA9-882D-085E7E0D269E.html) in the NSX-T Data Center documentation. See also [NSX Manager VM System Requirements](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center/2.4/installation/GUID-AECA2EE0-90FC-48C4-8EDB-66517ACFE415.html).

##<a id='nsx-mgr-about'></a> About the NSX Manager UI

The NSX-T Manager provides the user interface and API for NSX-T Data Center. There are two options to interact with NSX-T Manager:

1. Simplified UI/API
  - Declarative interface that uses the Declarative API/Data Model (Policy API).
  - The NSX-T Container Plugin (NCP) that is embedded in the Enterprise PKS tile does not support the Policy API.
  - You cannot use the Simplified UI/API to manage NSX-T for use with Enterprise PKS upgrades and new installations.

1. Advanced UI/API 
  - Legacy imperative interface based on the NSX Management API.
  - Provides the user interface to address Enterprise PKS installation and upgrade use cases. Currently NCP only supports the Management API.
  - Will be deprecated over time; all features and use cases will eventually be transfered to the Simplified UI/API.

<%= vars.product_short %> does not support the **Simplified UI/API**. For <%= vars.product_short %>, you must use the **Advanced Networking and Security** tab to create, read, update, and delete required network objects. For NSX-T host preparation and configuration, such as deploying NSX-T Managers and Edge Nodes, use the **System** tab.
