On vSphere, you can add individual users or user groups to <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console. You can assign roles to individual users or to groups. If you assign a role to a group, all of the users in that group have that role.

For information about the roles that you can assign, see [UAA Scopes for Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition Users](./uaa-scopes.html).

For information about the tasks that Cluster Managers can perform, see [Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition Architecture](./control-plane.html). The <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Administrator role allows users to manage the <%= vars.product_short %> infrastructure.
