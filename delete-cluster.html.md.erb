This topic describes how to delete a Kubernetes cluster deployed by <%= vars.product_full %>. Running the `tkgi delete-cluster` command automatically deletes all cluster objects.

If you are using <%= vars.product_short %> with NSX-T, see [vSphere with NSX-T Cluster Objects](vsphere-nsxt-cluster-objects.html) for a list of vSphere and NSX-T objects that will be deleted as part of the cluster deletion process.

## <a id='delete'></a>Delete Cluster 

You can delete a cluster using the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> CLI.  

To avoid an incomplete deletion, prepare the cluster for deletion before deleting it:  

1. If the cluster is configured with a PodDisruptionBudget (PDB), remove the PDB from the cluster.  
1. Remove all static and dynamic PVCs from the cluster.  
1. Remove all PVs with a reclaimPolicy of `Retain` from the cluster.

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Before deleting a cluster, 
    remove the PVs and PVCs from the cluster to avoid making orphan disks of the cluster's attached disks.
    </p>

<br>
To delete a cluster:

1. <%= partial 'login-api' %>

1. Run `tkgi delete-cluster CLUSTER-NAME` to delete a cluster. Replace `CLUSTER-NAME` with the unique name for your cluster.
For example:
  <pre class="terminal">$ tkgi delete-cluster my-cluster</pre>

1. Confirm cluster deletion by entering `y`, or cancel cluster deletion by entering `n`.<br><br>For example:
  <pre class="terminal">Are you sure you want to delete cluster my-cluster? (y/n)</pre>

## <a id='verify'></a>Verify Cluster Deletion

Follow the steps below to verify cluster deletion using the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> CLI.

1. To verify cluster deletion, run `tkgi cluster CLUSTER-NAME`. Replace `CLUSTER-NAME`
with the unique name for your cluster.<br><br>For example:
<pre class="terminal">$ tkgi cluster my-cluster
Name:                     my-cluster
Plan Name:                small
UUID:                     106aabc7-5ecb-4c54-a800-a32eef57a593
Last Action:              DELETE
Last Action State:        in progress
Last Action Description:  Instance deletion in progress
Kubernetes Master Host:   my-cluster.tkgi.local
Kubernetes Master Port:   8443
Worker Nodes:             3
Kubernetes Master IP(s):  10.196.219.88
Network Profile Name:
</pre>
While <%= vars.product_short %> is deleting the cluster, the value for `Last Action Description` is
`Instance deletion in progress`.

1. Continue running the `tkgi cluster CLUSTER-NAME` command to track cluster deletion.
The cluster is deleted when the CLI returns `Error: Cluster CLUSTER-NAME not found`.

1. Run `tkgi clusters`. The cluster you deleted should not appear in the list of <%= vars.product_short %> clusters.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If the cluster is not deleted, see <a href="troubleshoot-issues.html#cluster-delete-fail">Cluster Deletion Fails</a> in <em>Troubleshooting</em>.</p>

## <a id='non-interactive'></a>Delete Cluster without Prompt

If you do not want the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> CLI to prompt you to confirm cluster deletion, use the `--non-interactive` flag.<br><br>For example:
  <pre class="terminal">$ tkgi delete-cluster my-cluster --non-interactive</pre>

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you use the <code>--non-interactive</code> flag to delete multiple clusters, delete each cluster one by one. Do not create a script that deletes multiple clusters using the <code>--non-interactive</code> flag. If you do, the BOSH Director may hang and become unusable until you log in to BOSH and cancel each deletion task.</p>
