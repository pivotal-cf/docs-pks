After completing the steps in this topic, continue to
[Upgrading <%= vars.product_short %> (Antrea and Flannel Networking)](upgrade.html) or
[Upgrading <%= vars.product_short %> (NSX-T Networking)](upgrade-nsxt.html).  


##<a id='backup'></a> Back Up Your <%= vars.product_short %> Deployment

<%= vars.recommended_by %> recommends backing up your <%= vars.product_short %>
deployment and workloads before upgrading.
To back up <%= vars.product_short %>, see
[Backing Up and Restoring <%= vars.product_short %>](backup-and-restore.html).

##<a id='understand-upgrades'></a> Review What Happens During <%= vars.product_short %> Upgrades

If you have not already done so, review [About <%= vars.product_short %> Upgrades](understanding-upgrades.html).

Plan your upgrade based on your workload capacity and uptime requirements.

##<a id='review-changes'></a> Review Changes in <%= vars.product_short %> v1.13

Review the [Release Notes](release-notes.html) for <%= vars.product_short %> v1.13.

##<a id='upgrade-order'></a> Determine Upgrade Order (vSphere Only)

To determine the upgrade order for your <%= vars.product_short %> environment,
review
[Upgrade Order for <%= vars.product_short %> Environments on vSphere](upgrade-scenarios.html).

##<a id='expectations'></a> Set User Expectations and Restrict Cluster Access

Coordinate the <%= vars.product_short %> upgrade with cluster admins and users.
During the upgrade:

* Their workloads will remain active and accessible.

* They will be unable to perform cluster management functions,
including creating, resizing, updating, and deleting clusters.

* They will be unable to log in to <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> or use the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> CLI and other <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> control plane services.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Cluster admins should not start any cluster management tasks right before an upgrade.
Wait for cluster operations to complete before upgrading.
</p>

<%#
##<a id='update-default-scanner'></a> Update Default Scanner

The built-in Clair container image scanner is deprecated in favor of Trivy. If you have enabled
Clair, do one of the following before upgrading to < %= vars.product_short % > v1.13:

* Install the Harbor tile v2.2.1 and select the Trivy scanner as the default in
"Interrogation Service". For more information about the Harbor tile, see the
[VMware Harbor Registry](https://docs.pivotal.io/vmware-harbor/index.html) documentation.

* Install the Clair scanner outside of the Harbor tile VM and configure the Clair scanner as the
default scanner in "Interrogation Service". For more information, see
[Getting Started With Clair](https://github.com/quay/clair/blob/main/Documentation/howto/getting_started.md)
in the Clair documentation.

##<a id='upgrade-clusters'></a> Upgrade All Clusters

<%= vars.product_short %> v1.13 does not support clusters
running versions of <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> earlier than v1.12.

Before you upgrade from <%= vars.product_short %> v1.12 to v1.13,
you must upgrade all of your <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>-provisioned clusters
to v1.12.

To upgrade <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>-provisioned clusters:

1. Check the version of your clusters:

    ```
    tkgi clusters
    ```

1. If one or more of your clusters are running a version of
<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> earlier than v1.12, upgrade the clusters.
For instructions,
see [Upgrading Clusters](./upgrade-clusters.html).  

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: When upgrading <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> to mitigate the Apache Log4j vulnerability
you must also upgrade all <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> clusters.
</p>

##<a id='resource-usage'></a> Verify Your Clusters Support Upgrading

It is critical that you confirm that a cluster's resource usage is within the
recommended maximum limits before upgrading the cluster.

<%= vars.product_full %> upgrades a cluster by upgrading control plane and worker nodes individually.
The upgrade processes a control plane node by redistributing the node's workload, stopping the node, upgrading it and restoring its workload.
This redistribution of a node's workloads increases the resource usage on the remaining nodes during the upgrade process.

If a Kubernetes cluster control plane VM is operating too close to capacity, the upgrade can fail.

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning</strong>: Downtime is required to repair a cluster failure
  resulting from upgrading an overloaded Kubernetes cluster control plane VM.
</p>

To prevent workload downtime during a cluster upgrade, complete the following before upgrading a cluster:

1. Ensure none of the control plane VMs being upgraded will become overloaded during the cluster upgrade.
See [Control Plane Node VM Size](vm-sizing.html#master-sizing) for more information.

1. Review the cluster's workload resource usage.

1. Scale up the cluster if it is near capacity on its existing infrastructure.
Scale up your cluster by running the command below or create a new cluster
using a larger plan. For more information, see [Changing Cluster Configurations](scale-clusters.html).

    ```
    tkgi update-cluster CLUSTER-NAME --num-nodes NUMBER-OF-WORKER-NODES
    ```
    Where:
    * `CLUSTER-NAME` is the name of your cluster.
    * `NUMBER-OF-WORKER-NODES` is the number of worker nodes that you want to set for the cluster.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: VMware recommends that you avoid using the
    <code>tkgi resize</code> command to perform resizing operations.</p>

1. Run the cluster's workloads on at least three
worker VMs using multiple replicas of your workloads spread across those VMs.
For more information, see [Maintaining Workload Uptime](maintain-uptime.html).

##<a id='verify-k8s-health'></a> Verify Health of Kubernetes Environment

Verify that your Kubernetes environment is healthy.
To verify the health of your Kubernetes environment, see [Verifying Deployment Health](verify-health.html).


##<a id='review-configurations'></a> Verify Your Environment Configuration

If you are upgrading <%= vars.product_short %>, 
verify the configuration of your environment supports the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> version you are installing:  

* [Verify Your vSphere with NSX-T Configuration](#review-vsphere-nsxt)  
* [Verify Your Antrea Environment Configuration](#review-non-nsxt)  

If you are using Flannel networking, this verification step is unnecessary.  

###<a id='review-vsphere-nsxt'></a> Verify Your vSphere with NSX-T Configuration

If you are upgrading <%= vars.product_short %> for environments using vSphere with NSX-T, perform the following steps:

1. Verify that the vSphere datastores have enough space.
1. Verify that the vSphere hosts have enough memory.
1. Verify that there are no alarms in vSphere.
1. Verify that the vSphere hosts are in a good state.
1. Verify that NSX Edge is configured for high availability.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Workloads in your Kubernetes cluster are unavailable while
  the NSX Edge nodes run the upgrade unless you configure NSX Edge for high availability. For more
  information, see the <a href="./nsxt-prepare-env.html#nsx-edge-ha">Configure NSX Edge for High Availability (HA)</a>
section of <em>Preparing NSX-T Before Deploying <%= vars.product_short %></em>.</p>

###<a id='review-non-nsxt'></a> Verify Your Antrea Environment Configuration

If you are upgrading <%= vars.product_short %> in an environment using Antrea networking, 
perform the following steps:

1. Verify the 6081 UDP port is open on all worker node VMs.  
1. Verify the 8091 TCP port is open on all control plane node VMs.  
1. Verify your environment configuration meets the Antrea networking requirements. 
For more information, see [Network Requirements](https://github.com/antrea-io/antrea/blob/main/docs/network-requirements.md#network-requirements) 
in the Antrea GitHub repository.  

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Port 6081 must be open on all of the worker node VMs and 
  port 8091 must be open on all control plane node VMs in the clusters you create in an Antrea networking environment.</p>

##<a id='clean-up'></a> Clean Up or Fix Failed Kubernetes Clusters

Clean up or fix any previous failed attempts to create <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> clusters
with the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Command Line Interface
(<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> CLI) by performing the following steps:

1. View your deployed clusters by running the following command:

    ```
    tkgi clusters
    ```

    If the `Status` of any cluster displays as `FAILED`, continue to the next step. If no cluster
    displays as `FAILED`, no action is required. Continue to the next section.

1. To troubleshoot and fix failed clusters, perform the procedure in [Cluster Creation Fails](troubleshoot-issues.html#cluster-create-fail).

1. To clean up failed BOSH deployments related to failed clusters, perform the procedure in [Cannot Re-Create a Cluster that Failed to Deploy](troubleshoot-issues.html#cluster-recreate-fails).

1. After fixing and cleaning up any failed clusters, view your deployed clusters again by running `tkgi clusters`.

For more information about troubleshooting and fixing failed clusters, see the [Knowledge Base](https://community.pivotal.io/s/topic/0TO0P000000IKdbWAG/pivotal-container-service).

##<a id='unique-hostname'></a> Verify Kubernetes Clusters Have Unique External Hostnames

Verify that existing Kubernetes clusters have unique external hostnames by checking for multiple
Kubernetes clusters with the same external hostname. Perform the following steps:

1. Log in to the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> CLI. For more information, see
[Logging in to <%= vars.product_short %>](login.html). You must log in with an account that has the
UAA scope of `pks.clusters.admin`. For more information about UAA scopes, see
[Managing <%= vars.product_short %> Users with UAA](manage-users.html).

1. View your deployed <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> clusters by running the following command:

    ```
    tkgi clusters
    ```
1. For each deployed cluster, run `tkgi cluster CLUSTER-NAME` to view the details of the cluster.
For example:

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ tkgi cluster my-cluster
    </pre>
    Examine the output to verify that the `Kubernetes Master Host` is unique for each cluster.

##<a id='tkgi-proxy'></a> Verify <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Proxy Configuration

Verify your current <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> proxy configuration by performing the following steps:

1. Check whether an existing proxy is enabled:
    1. Log in to Ops Manager.
    1. Click the **VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition** tile.
    1. Click **Networking**.
    1. If **HTTP/HTTPS Proxy** is **Disabled**, no action is required. Continue to the next section.
       If **HTTP/HTTPS Proxy** is **Enabled**, continue to the next step.

1. If the existing **No Proxy** field contains any of the following values, or you plan to add any
of the following values, contact Support:
	* `localhost`
	* Hostnames containing dashes, such as `my-host.mydomain.com`

##<a id='check-poddisruptionbudget-value'></a> Check PodDisruptionBudget Value

<%= vars.product_short %> upgrades can run without ever completing if any Kubernetes app has a `PodDisruptionBudget`
with `maxUnavailable` set to `0`.

To ensure that no apps have a `PodDisruptionBudget` with
`maxUnavailable` set to `0`:

1. Run the following `kubectl` command to verify the `PodDisruptionBudget` as the cluster administrator:

    ```
    kubectl get poddisruptionbudgets --all-namespaces
    ```

1. Examine the output to verify that no app displays `0` in the `MAX UNAVAILABLE` column.

## <a id="configure-node-drain"></a> (Optional) Configure Node Drain Behavior

During the <%= vars.product_tile %> upgrade process, worker nodes are cordoned and drained.
Workloads can prevent worker nodes from draining and cause the upgrade to fail or hang.

To prevent hanging cluster upgrades, you can configure default node drain behavior using the following methods:  

* [Configure with the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Tile](#node-drain-tile)  
* [Configure with the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> CLI](#node-drain-cli)  

The new default behavior takes effect during the next upgrade,
not immediately after configuring the behavior.

### <a id="node-drain-tile"></a> Configure with the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Tile

To configure node drain behavior in the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile,
see <a href="./troubleshoot-issues.html#upgrade-drain-hangs">Worker Node Hangs Indefinitely</a>
in <i>Troubleshooting</i>.</p>

### <a id="node-drain-cli"></a> Configure with the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> CLI

To configure default node drain behavior with the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> CLI:

1. View the current node drain behavior by running the following command:

    ```
    tkgi cluster CLUSTER-NAME --details
    ```

    Where `CLUSTER-NAME` is the name of your cluster.
    <br><br>
    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">$ tkgi cluster my-cluster --details <br>
      Name:                     my-cluster
      Plan Name:                small
      UUID:                     f55ed6c4-c0a7-451d-b735-56c89fdb2ad7
      Last Action:              CREATE
      Last Action State:        succeeded
      Last Action Description:  Instance provisioning completed
      Kubernetes Master Host:   my-cluster.tkgi.local
      Kubernetes Master Port:   8443
      Worker Nodes:             3
      Kubernetes Master IP(s):  10.196.219.88
      Network Profile Name:
      Kubernetes Settings Details:
        Set by Cluster:
        Kubelet Node Drain timeout (mins)            (kubelet-drain-timeout):               10
        Kubelet Node Drain grace-period (mins)       (kubelet-drain-grace-period):          10
        Kubelet Node Drain force                     (kubelet-drain-force):                 true
        Set by Plan:
        Kubelet Node Drain force-node                (kubelet-drain-force-node):            true
        Kubelet Node Drain ignore-daemonsets         (kubelet-drain-ignore-daemonsets):     true
        Kubelet Node Drain delete-local-data         (kubelet-drain-delete-local-data):     true
      </pre>

1. Configure the default node drain behavior by running the following command:

    ```
    tkgi update-cluster CLUSTER-NAME FLAG
    ```

    Where:
    + `CLUSTER-NAME` is the name of your cluster.
    + `FLAG` is an action flag for updating the node drain behavior.

    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">$ tkgi update-cluster my-cluster --kubelet-drain-timeout 1 --kubelet-drain-grace-period 5<br>
    Update summary for cluster my-cluster:
    Kubelet Drain Timeout: 1
    Kubelet Drain Grace Period: 5
    Are you sure you want to continue? (y/n): y
    Use 'tkgi cluster my-cluster' to monitor the state of your cluster</pre>

    For a list of the available action flags for setting node drain behavior,
    see [tkgi update-cluster](cli/index.html#update-cluster) in _<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> CLI_.
	</pre>
