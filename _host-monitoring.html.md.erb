The **Host Monitoring** pane provides settings for 
monitoring host VMs in your <%= vars.product_short %> deployment.
In this pane, you can configure <%= vars.product_short %> to
forward logs from your BOSH-deployed VMs to a syslog endpoint as well as 
configure transport of multiple metric sources.
These settings are not visible to Kubernetes cluster users.

To configure host monitoring in the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile, do the following:

* To configure Syslog for BOSH-deployed VMs, see [Syslog](#host-syslog).
<% if current_page.data.iaas == "vSphere" || current_page.data.iaas == "vSphere-NSX-T" %>
* To configure VMware vRealize Log Insight Integration, see [VMware vRealize Log Insight Integration](#vrealize-logs).
<% end %>
* To configure the Telegraf agent, see [Telegraf](#telegraf).

####<a id='host-syslog'></a> Syslog

1. Click **Host Monitoring**.
1. Under **Enable Syslog for PKS**, select **Yes**.
1. Under **Address**, enter the destination syslog endpoint.
1. Under **Port**, enter the destination syslog port.
1. Under **Transport Protocol**, select a transport protocol for log forwarding.
1. (Optional) To enable TLS encryption during log forwarding, complete the following steps:
  1. Ensure **Enable TLS** is selected.  
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Logs may contain sensitive information, such as cloud provider credentials.
  Pivotal strongly recommends that you enable TLS encryption for log forwarding.
  </p>  
  1. Under **Permitted Peer**, provide the accepted fingerprint (SHA1) or name of remote peer. For example, `*.YOUR-LOGGING-SYSTEM.com`.
  1. Under **TLS Certificate**, provide a TLS certificate for the destination syslog endpoint.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: You do not need to provide a new certificate if the TLS certificate for the destination syslog endpoint is signed by a Certificate Authority (CA) in your BOSH certificate store.
  </p>
1. (Optional) Under **Max Message Size**, enter a maximum message size for logs that are forwarded to a syslog endpoint. By default, the **Max Message Size** field is 10,000 characters. 
1. Click **Save**.

In **Host Monitoring**, you can configure the Telegraf agent to collect metrics from Node Exporter, etcd, and the Kubelet agent
and send the metrics to a third-party monitoring service:

* Node Exporter, a Prometheus monitoring service, provides infrastructure and OS metrics.
For more information about Node Exporter metrics, see the [Node Exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter#enabled-by-default) GitHub repository.
* etcd provides local monitoring information that can be used for system health checking and cluster debugging.
* Kubelet provides an endpoint with metrics for all workloads running in each Kubernetes cluster.

To connect a third-party monitoring service to <%= vars.product_short %>, complete the following steps:  

1. Create a configuration file for the third-party monitoring service.
For instructions, see [Create a Configuration File](./monitor-etcd.html#toml).
1. (Optional) Select **Include etcd metrics**. This includes etcd server and debug metrics. 
1. (Optional) Select **Enable node exporter on master**. This enables Node Exporter on the _localhost_ of each master node VM.
1. (Optional) Select **Include kubelet metrics**. This includes all workload metrics across your Kubernetes clusters. Enabling **Include kubelet metrics** generates a high volume of metrics.
1. To enable a third-party monitoring service, configure **Setup Telegraf Outputs**. Enter the contents of the configuration file you created. 
If you do not want to output any metrics, leave the default value `[[outputs.discard]]`.
1. Click **Save**.
