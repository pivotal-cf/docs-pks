This topic describes the firewall ports and protocols requirements for using <%= vars.product_full %> (<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>)
on vSphere.  

If you are not using <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> on vSphere without NSX-T, see one of the follow topics instead:

* [Firewall Ports and Protocols Requirements for vSphere with NSX-T](ports-protocols-nsx-t.html)
* [Firewall Ports and Protocols Requirements](ports-protocols-antrea.html)


## <a id="overview"></a> Overview

Firewalls and security policies are used to filter traffic and limit access in environments with strict 
inter-network access control policies.  

Apps frequently require the ability to pass internal communication between system components on 
different networks and require one or more conduits through the environment's firewalls.  

You must configure firewall rules to enable apps to interface with external systems such as with 
enterprise apps or apps and data on the public Internet.  

For <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>, <%= vars.recommended_by %> recommends that you enable access to apps 
through standard Kubernetes load-balancers and ingress controller types, 
rather than using security policies to filter traffic between the networks supporting the system. 
This enables you to designate specific ports and protocols as a firewall conduit.  

Consult the following tables when configuring port settings to install or upgrade <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> 
or configure a Kubernetes cluster:

* [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Users Ports and Protocols](#users)  
* [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Core Ports and Protocols](#core)  
* [VMware Virtual Infrastructure Ports and Protocols](#virtual-infra)  
* [VMware Optional Integration Ports and Protocols](#optional-integration)  
* [Antrea Networking Ports and Protocols](#antrea)

Consult the tables above when configuring port settings to install or upgrade <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> 
or configure a Kubernetes cluster.  

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: To control which groups access deploying and scaling 
your organization's <%= vars.product_short %>-deployed Kubernetes clusters, configure your firewall settings 
as described on the Operator â€“> <%= vars.control_plane %> server lines below.</p>
