This topic describes how to deploy multiple instances of <%= vars.product_short %> (<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>) on vSphere with NSX-T infrastructure.

## <a id='about'></a> About Multi-Foundation <%= vars.product_short %>

A multi-foundation deployment of <%= vars.product_short %> lets you install and run multiple instances of <%= vars.product_short %>. The purpose of a multi-foundation deployment of <%= vars.product_short %> is to share a common vSphere and NSX-T infrastructure across multiple foundations, while providing complete networking isolation across foundations.

As shown in the diagram, with a multi-foundation <%= vars.product_short %> topology, each <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> instance is deployed to a dedicated NSX-T Tier-0 router. Foundation A T0 router with Management CIDR 10.0.0.0/16 connects to the vSphere and NSX-T infrastructure. Similarly, Foundation B T0 router with Management CIDR  20.0.0.0/16 connects to the same vSphere and NSX-T components.

As with a single instance deployment, <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> management components are deployed to a dedicated network, for example, 10.0.0.0/24 for <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Foundation A; 20.0.0.0/24 for <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Foundation B. When <%= vars.product_short %> is deployed, networks are defined for nodes, pods, and load balancers. Because of the dedicated Tier-0 router, there is complete networking isolation between each <%= vars.product_short %> instance.

## <a id="prereqs"></a> Requirements

To implement a multi-foundation <%= vars.product_short %> topology, adhere to the following requirements:

- One Tier-0 router for each <%= vars.product_short %> instance. For more information, see <a href="./nsxt-multi-t0.html">Isolating Tenants</a>.
- The Floating IP pool must not overlap. The CIDR range for each Floating IP Pool must be unique and not overlapping across foundations. For more information, see <a href="./nsxt-create-objects.html">Create Floating IP Pool</a>.
- <%= vars.product_short %> instances can be deployed in NAT and no-NAT mode. If more than one <%= vars.product_short %> instance is deployed in no-NAT mode, the Nodes IP Block networks cannot overlap.
- For any Pods IP Block used to deploy Kubernetes clusters in no-NAT (routable) mode, the Pods IP Block cannot overlap across foundations.
- The [NSX-T Super User Principal Identity Certificate](./nsxt-generate-pi-cert.html) is unique per <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> instance.

The image below shows three <%= vars.product_short %> installations across three Tier-0 foundations. Key considerations to keep in mind with a multi-foundation <%= vars.product_short %> topology include the following:

- Each foundation must rely on a dedicated Tier-0 router
- You can mix-and-match NAT and no-NAT mode across foundations for Node and Pod networks
- If you are using non-routable Pods IP Block networks, the Pods IP Block addresses can overlap across foundations
- Because Kubernetes nodes are behind a dedicated Tier-0 router, if clusters are deployed in NAT mode the Nodes IP Block addresses can also overlap across foundations
- For each foundation you must define a unique Floating ID Pool with non-overlapping IPs
