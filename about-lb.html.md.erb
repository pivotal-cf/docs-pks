This topic describes the <%= vars.product_full %> (<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>) load balancers for the <%= vars.control_plane %> and <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> clusters and workloads. 


<br>
<br>
## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

Load balancers used with <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> differ by the type of deployment:

* [Load Balancers in <%= vars.product_short %> Deployments without NSX](#without-nsx-t)  
* [Load Balancers in <%= vars.product_short %> Deployments on vSphere with NSX](#with-nsx-t)  


<br>
<br>
## <a id='without-nsx-t'></a>Load Balancers in <%= vars.product_short %> Deployments without NSX

For <%= vars.product_short %> deployments on GCP, AWS, or vSphere without NSX, you can configure load balancers for the following:

* **[<%= vars.control_plane %> Load Balancer](#tkgi-api)**: Configuring this load balancer enables you to run <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Command Line Interface (<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> CLI) commands from your local workstation.
* **[Kubernetes Cluster Load Balancers](#cluster)**: Configuring a load balancer for each new cluster enables you to run Kubernetes CLI (kubectl) commands on the cluster.
* **[Workload Load Balancers)](#workload)**: Configuring a load balancer for your application workloads enables external access to the services that run on your cluster. 

The following diagram, applicable to GCP, AWS, and vSphere without NSX, shows where each of the above load balancers can be used 
within your <%= vars.product_short %> deployment.

If you use either vSphere without NSX or GCP, you are expected to create your own load balancers within your cloud provider console. 
If your cloud provider does not offer load balancing, you can use any external TCP or HTTPS load balancer of your choice.

<br>
### <a id='tkgi-api'></a><%= vars.control_plane %> Load Balancer

The <%= vars.control_plane %> load balancer enables you to access the <%= vars.control_plane %> from outside the network on <%= vars.product_short %> deployments on GCP, AWS, and on vSphere without NSX.
For example, configuring a load balancer for the <%= vars.control_plane %> enables you to run <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> CLI commands from your local workstation.

For information about configuring the <%= vars.control_plane %> load balancer on vSphere without NSX, see [Configuring <%= vars.control_plane %> Load Balancer](./vsphere-configure-api.html).

<br>
### <a id='cluster'></a>Kubernetes Cluster Load Balancers

When you create an <%= vars.product_short %> cluster on GCP, AWS, and on vSphere without NSX, 
you must configure external access to the cluster by creating an external TCP or HTTPS load balancer. 
The load balancer enables the Kubernetes CLI to communicate with the cluster.

If you create a cluster in a non-production environment, you can choose not to use a load balancer.
To enable kubectl to access the cluster without a load balancer, you can do one of the following:

* Create a DNS entry that points to the cluster's control plane VM. For example: `my-cluster.example.com    A    10.0.0.5`
* On the workstation where you run kubectl commands, add the control plane IP address of your cluster and `kubo.internal` to the `/etc/hosts` file. For example: `10.0.0.5 kubo.internal`

For more information about configuring a cluster load balancer, see the following:

* [Creating and Configuring a GCP Load Balancer for <%= vars.product_short %> Clusters](gcp-cluster-load-balancer.html)
* [Creating and Configuring an AWS Load Balancer for <%= vars.product_short %> Clusters](aws-cluster-load-balancer.html)
* [Creating and Configuring an Azure Load Balancer for <%= vars.product_short %> Clusters](azure-cluster-load-balancer.html)

<br>
### <a id='workload'></a>Workload Load Balancers

To enable external access to your <%= vars.product_short %> app on GCP, AWS, and on vSphere without NSX, you can either create a load balancer or expose a static port on your workload.

For information about configuring a load balancer for your app workload, see [Deploying and Exposing Basic Linux Workloads](deploy-workloads.html).

If you use AWS, you must configure routing in the AWS console before you can create a load balancer for your workload.
You must create a public subnet in each availability zone (AZ) where you are deploying the workload and tag the public subnet with your cluster's unique identifier.

See the [AWS Prerequisites](deploy-workloads.html#aws) section of _Deploying and Exposing Basic Linux Workloads_ before you create a workload load balancer.

#### <a id='with-ingress'></a>Deploy Your Workload Load Balancer with an Ingress Controller
A Kubernetes ingress controller sits behind a load balancer, routing HTTP and HTTPS requests from outside the cluster to services within the cluster. 
Kubernetes ingress resources can be configured to load balance traffic, provide externally reachable URLs to services, and manage other aspects of network traffic.  

If you add an ingress controller to your <%= vars.product_short %> deployment, traffic routing is controlled by the ingress resource rules you define. 
<%= vars.recommended_by %> recommends configuring <%= vars.product_short %> deployments with both a workload load balancer and an ingress controller.  

The following diagram shows how the ingress routing can be used 
within your <%= vars.product_short %> deployment. 
<%= image_tag("images/ingress-routing.png", :alt => "TKGI diagram that shows ingress routing for both Istio and NSX") %>
<%#= Image source: https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1IB2juuTQlwJ4QpRaMmjFvGAC3cS7irFy3OII-pb6GGE/edit %>

The load balancer on <%= vars.product_short %> on vSphere with NSX is automatically provisioned with Kubernetes ingress resources 
without the need to deploy and configure an additional ingress controller.  

For information about deploying a load balancer configured with ingress routing on GCP, AWS, Azure, and vSphere without NSX, see [Configuring Ingress Routing](configure-ingress.html). 
For information about ingress routing on vSphere with NSX, see [Configuring Ingress Resources and Load Balancer Services](nsxt-ingress-srvc-lb.html).

## <a id='with-nsx-t'></a>Load Balancers in <%= vars.product_short %> Deployments on vSphere with NSX

<%= vars.product_short %> deployments on vSphere with NSX in high-availability mode require you configure a load balancer to access the <%= vars.control_plane %>. 
To configure an NSX load balancer for <%= vars.control_plane %> traffic, see [Provisioning an NSX Load Balancer for the TKGI API Server](nsxt-lb-tkgi-api.html).  

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> deployments on vSphere with NSX in singleton mode require you configure only a DNAT rule so that the <%= vars.control_plane %> host is accessible.
These <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> deployments do not require you to configure a load balancer to access the <%= vars.control_plane %>. 
For more information, see [Share the <%= vars.product_short %> Endpoint](installing-nsx-t.html#retrieve-endpoint) in _Installing <%= vars.product_short %> on vSphere with NSX Integration_.

At runtime, NSX automatically handles load balancer creation, configuration, and deletion as part of the Kubernetes cluster create, update, and delete process.
When a new Kubernetes cluster is created, NSX creates and configures a dedicated load balancer tied to it. The load balancer is a shared resource designed to provide efficient traffic distribution to control plane nodes as well as services deployed on worker nodes.
Each application service is mapped to a virtual server instance, carved out from the same load balancer.
For more information, see [Logical Load Balancer](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T/2.1/com.vmware.nsxt.admin.doc/GUID-46567C8D-A5C5-4793-8CDF-858E58FDE3C4.html) in the NSX-T documentation.

Virtual server instances are created on the load balancer to provide access to the following:

* **Kubernetes API and UI services on a Kubernetes cluster**. This enables requests to be load balanced across multiple control plane nodes.
* **Ingress controller**. This enables the virtual server instance to dispatch HTTP and HTTPS requests to services associated with Ingress rules.
* `type:loadbalancer` **services**. This enables the server to handle TCP connections or UDP flows toward exposed services.

Load balancers are deployed in high-availability mode so that they are resilient to potential failures and able to recover quickly from critical conditions.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The <code>NodePort</code> Service type is not supported for <%= vars.product_short %> deployments on vSphere with NSX. Only <code>type:LoadBalancer</code>Services and Services associated with Ingress rules are supported on vSphere with NSX.</p>

<br>
### <a id='resize-lb'></a> Resizing Load Balancers

When a new Kubernetes cluster is provisioned using the <%= vars.control_plane %>, NSX creates a dedicated load balancer for that new cluster. By default, the size of the load balancer is set to Small.

With network profiles, you can change the size of the load balancer deployed by NSX at the time of cluster creation. For information about network profiles, see [Using Network Profiles (NSX Only)](network-profiles.html).

For more information about the types of load balancers NSX provisions and their capacities, see [Scaling Load Balancer Resources](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center/2.3/com.vmware.nsxt.admin.doc/GUID-19B12230-8BF4-4AF7-9EB7-3701B0A0A439.html) in the NSX-T documentation.
