Before you begin upgrading the PKS tile, follow the steps below:

1. Review the [Release Notes](release-notes.html) for the version or versions of PKS you are upgrading to.
1. Verify that your Kubernetes environment is healthy. To verify the health of your Kubernetes environment, see [Verifying
Deployment Health](verify-health.html#k8s).
1. Make sure there are no issues with vSphere by following the steps below:
  1. Verify that datastores have enough space.
  1. Verify that hosts have enough memory.
  1. Verify that there are no alarms.
  1. Verify that hosts are in a good state.
1. Verify that NSX Edge is configured for high availability using Active/Standby mode. 
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Workloads in your Kubernetes cluster are unavailable while the NSX Edge nodes run the upgrade unless you configure NSX Edge for high availability. For more information, see the <a href="./nsxt-prepare-env.html#nsx-edge-ha">Configure NSX Edge for High Availability (HA)</a> section of <em>Preparing NSX-T Before Deploying PKS</em>.</p>
1. (Optional) Back up the environment using the procedures in the following topics:
  - <a href="https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Pivotal-Container-Service/1.1/vmware-pks-11/GUID-PKS11-backup-and-restore.html">Backup PKS</a>
  - <a href="https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T/2.1/com.vmware.nsxt.admin.doc/GUID-A0B3667C-FB7D-413F-816D-019BFAD81AC5.html">Backup NSX-T</a>
  - <a href="https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/2149237">Backup vCenter</a>
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you choose not to back up PKS, NSX-T, or vCenter, we recommend backing up the NSX-T and NSX-T Container Plugin (NCP) logs. For more information, see <a href="#logs">PKS Logs for NSX-T and NCP</a> below.</p>

## <a id="upgrade"></a> During the Upgrade

This section describes the steps required to upgrade to PKS v1.2 with NSX-T v2.3.

### <a id="upgrade-pks-1.1.5"></a> Step 1: Upgrade to PKS v1.1.5 or Later

Skip this step if you are already running PKS v1.1.5+.

Follow the procedures detailed in [Upgrading PKS with NSX-T](https://docs.pivotal.io/runtimes/pks/1-1/upgrade-pks-nsxt.html) in the PKS v1.1 documentation.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> PKS v1.1.5 with NSX-T introduces architectural changes that require larger sized worker node VMs. Before you upgrade to PKS v1.1.5 or later, you must increase the size of the Kubernetes worker node VM. For more information on how to increase the worker node VM size, see <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/runtimes/pks/1-1/upgrade-pks.html#upgrade-tile">Increase the Kubernetes Worker Node VM Size</a> in the PKS v1.1 documentation. For more information about the architectural changes in PKS v1.1.5 with NSX-T, see <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/runtimes/pks/1-1/release-notes.html#arch-changes">NSX-T Architectural Changes</a> in the PKS v1.1.5 Release Notes. 
</p>

### <a id="upgrade-nsxt-2.2"></a> Step 2: Upgrade to NSX-T v2.2

Skip this step if you are already running NSX-T v2.2.

To upgrade to NSX-T v2.2, follow the procedures detailed in [Upgrading NSX-T](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T/2.2/com.vmware.nsxt.upgrade.doc/GUID-E04242D7-EF09-4601-8906-3FA77FBB06BD.html) in the VMware documentation.

### <a id="upgrade-opsman"></a> Step 3: Upgrade to Ops Manager v2.2.3+ or v2.3.1+

Before you upgrade to PKS v1.2.x, you must upgrade to Ops Manager v2.2.3+ or v2.3.1+.
 
1. Follow the procedures detailed in [Upgrade Ops Manager and Installed Products to v2.2](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-2/customizing/upgrading-pcf.html#upgrade_ops) or [Upgrade Ops Manager and Installed Products to v2.3](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-3/customizing/upgrading-pcf.html#upgrade_ops).

1. <%= partial 'add-clusters-workloads' %>

### <a id="upgrade-pks"></a> Step 4: Upgrade to PKS v1.2.x

To upgrade PKS, you follow the same Ops Manager process that you use to install
the tile for the first time.

Your configuration settings migrate to the new version automatically. 
Follow the steps below to perform an upgrade.

1. Review the [Release Notes](release-notes.html) for the version you are upgrading to.

1. Download the desired version of the product from [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-container-service/).

1. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Import a Product**.

1. Browse to the PKS product file and select it. Uploading the file takes several minutes.

  <img src="images/upgrade-nsxt-3.png" alt="Import the PKS product file">

### <a id="stemcell"></a> Step 5: Download and Import the Stemcell

PKS v1.2.x uses a [Xenial stemcell](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/stemcells/#xenial). 

If Ops Manager does not have the Xenial stemcell required for PKS, the PKS tile displays the message **Missing stemcell**. 

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If the <b>Stemcell Library</b> in Ops Manager already has a compatible Xenial stemcell, 
  the <b>Missing stemcell</b> link does not appear. You do not need to download or import a new stemcell and can skip this step.</p>

To download and import a new Xenial stemcell, follow the steps below:

1. On the **Pivotal Container Service** tile, click on the **Missing stemcell** link.

    <img src="images/missing_stemcell.png" alt="Verify stemcell assignment">

1. In the **Stemcell Library**, locate Pivotal Container Service and note the required stemcell version.

1. Visit the [Stemcells for PCF (Ubuntu Xenial)](https://network.pivotal.io/products/stemcells-ubuntu-xenial/) page on Pivotal Network, 
and download the required stemcell version for vSphere.

1. Return to the **Installation Dashboard** in Ops Manager, and click on **Stemcell Library**.

1. On the **Stemcell Library** page, click **Import Stemcell** and select the stemcell file you downloaded from Pivotal Network.

### <a id="worker-nodes"></a> Step 6: Verify Errand Configuration

To verify that errands are configured correctly in the PKS tile, perform the following steps.

1. In the PKS tile, click **Errands**.

1. Under **Post-Deploy Errands**, verify that the listed errands are configured as follows:
  * **NSX-T Validation errand**: Set to **On**
  * **Upgrade all clusters errand**: Set to **Default (On)**
  * **Create pre-defined Wavefront alerts errand**: Set to **Default (Off)**

    <p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING</strong>: If you set the <strong>Upgrade all clusters errand</strong> to <strong>Off</strong>, your Kubernetes cluster version will fall behind the PKS tile version. If your clusters fall more than one version behind the tile, you can no longer upgrade the clusters. You must upgrade your clusters to match the PKS tile version before the next tile upgrade.</p>

1. If you make any changes, click **Save**.

### <a id="apply-changes"></a> Step 6: Apply Changes to the PKS Tile
