<%= vars.product_short %>-provisioned clusters send usage data to the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> control plane for storage. 
The VMware Customer Experience Improvement Program (CEIP) and Telemetry Program provide the option to also 
send the cluster usage data to VMware to improve customer experience.  

To configure <%= vars.product_short %> CEIP and Telemetry Program settings:

1. Click **CEIP and Telemetry**.
1. Review the information about the CEIP and Telemetry.
1. To specify your level of participation in the CEIP and Telemetry program, select one of the **Participation Level** options:  
  * **None:** If you select this option, the data collected by <%= vars.product_short %> is not sent to VMware.  
  * (Default) **Standard:** If you select this option, the data collected by <%= vars.product_short %> is sent to VMware 
  anonymously. 
  This anonymous participation level does not permit the CEIP and Telemetry to identify your organization.  
  * **Enhanced:** If you select this option, the data collected by <%= vars.product_short %> is sent to VMware. 
  This participation level permits the CEIP and Telemetry to identify your organization.
