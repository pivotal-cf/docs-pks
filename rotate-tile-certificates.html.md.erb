This topic describes how to rotate certificates used only by
the <%= vars.product_short %> (<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>) control plane and tile.  

This topic covers rotating <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> control plane certificates only. 
For more information about <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Certificates:  

* For conceptual information about certificates in <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>, 
see [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Certificates](certificate-concepts.html).  
* To rotate the certificates used by <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>-deployed Kubernetes clusters, 
see [Rotating Cluster Certificates](./rotate-cluster-certificates.html).  



<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> If you use the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Management Console 
  to manage <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> on vSphere with NSX&#8209;T, 
  you must use the Management Console to rotate the NSX Manager CA Certificate. 
  To manage your NSX Manager CA Certificate using the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Management Console, see 
  <a href="console-reconfigure.html#reconfigure-options ">Which Options Can I Reconfigure?</a> 
  in <em>Reconfigure Your <%= vars.product_short %> Deployment</em>.

## <a id="overview"></a>Overview

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> control plane certificates, and their leaf certificates, are automatically generated by <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>
during installation:  

* `pxc_server_ca`  
* `pxc_galera_ca`  
* `uaa_active_pks_saml_key_2018`  
* `kubo_odb_ca_2018`  

Control plane certificates have a default expiration period of four years.  

To rotate <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> control plane certificates, 
first determine which certificates are due to expire and then rotate them:  

* [Check Certificate Expiration Dates](#expiration)  
* [Rotate TKGI Control Plane Certificates](#control)  

The procedures below can be used to rotate <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> control plane certificates, 
certificates for <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> communication with underlying Ops Manager and BOSH infrastructure, and 
certificates for components such as database, CredHub, UAA, and Telemetry.  

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong>
Never use the CredHub Maestro <code>maestro regenerate ca/leaf --all</code> command to rotate <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> certificates.
</p>

## <a id="expiration"></a>Check Certificate Expiration Dates

Before rotating your certificates, verify which certificates require rotation.

To check certificate expiration dates, see 
[Check Expiration Dates and Certificate Types](https://docs.pivotal.io/ops-manager/security/pcf-infrastructure/advanced-certificate-rotation.html#check-expiration)
in the Ops Manager documentation.

## <a id="control"></a>Rotate TKGI Control Plane Certificates

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> control plane and tile certificates are configurable and non-configurable certificates stored in CredHub.
For an explanation of configurable, non-configurable, and other certificate types, see [Certificate Types](https://docs.pivotal.io/ops-manager/security/pcf-infrastructure/certificate-types.html)
in the Ops Manager documentation.


Rotate configurable and non-configurable certificates as follows:

* Rotate **configurable** certificates in the tile interface by entering new values
and redeploying the tile.
  - **All infrastructures**: The `pks_tls` cert is configured in the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> tile > **TKGI API** pane.
  - **vSphere with NSX-T**: After rotating the following two configurable certificates, you must also re-register them with the NSX Manager.
  For instructions, see [Rotate the Principal Identity Certificate and Key](./nsxt-generate-pi-cert.html#certificates-nsx-pid-rotate) in _Generating and Registering the NSX Manager Superuser Principal Identity Certificate and Key_:
      - **NSX Manager Super User Principal Identity Certificate**, `nsx-t-superuser-certificate`
      - **NSX Manager CA Cert**, `nsx-t-ca-cert`  

* **Non-configurable** certificates rotate automatically with selected tile upgrades. 
Most of these certificates have four- or five-year expiry periods, 
so users do not ordinarily need to rotate them.  
    * To rotate **Non-configurable** certificates, use the Rotate Control Plane Certificates Tool.
