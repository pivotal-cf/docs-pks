title: Create Clusters in the Management Console
owner: TKGI
---

You can deploy Kubernetes clusters to <%= vars.product_short %> directly from  <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console on vSphere.

When you deploy Kubernetes clusters from the management console, you select the following pre-existing resources to configure your cluster:

- A plan from the list of plans that were defined when the management console was deployed.
- An optional network profile. Network profiles allow cluster administrators and cluster managers to customize the networking for different types of Kubernetes cluster. For information about how to create network profiles in the management console, see [Working with Network Profiles](console-network-profile.html).
- An optional Kubernetes profile. Kubernetes profiles enable cluster administrators and cluster managers to customize Kubernetes component settings for any clusters that they provision. You create Kubernetes profiles outside of the management console, by using the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> CLI to define the Kubernetes profile in your <%= vars.product_short %> instance..

1. Go to the **TKG Integrated Edition** view of the management console.
1. Select the **Clusters** tab and click **Create Cluster**.

1. Use the **Plan** drop-down menu to select one of the plans that were configured during the deployment of <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console.

    The plan defines the set of resources that the Kubernetes cluster will use. A summary of the selected plan appears as you hover over each option.

1. Enter a name and a host name for the cluster, and specify the number of worker nodes to create.

1. Use the **Network Profile** and **Compute Profile** drop-down menus to select existing network and compute profiles for the cluster to use.

     If you have not created any network or compute profiles, the management console uses the default profiles. In this case, <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console configures networking and compute for you, based on the plan that you selected.
1. Optionally use the Kubernetes Profile drop-down menu to select an existing Kubernetes profile for the cluster to use.

     If you have not created any Kubernetes profiles, the management console uses the default Kubernetes profile. In this case, <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console configures the cluster for you, based on the plan that you selected.

1. Click **Create** to deploy your cluster.

    You can follow the progress of the deployment of your cluster in the **Clusters** tab.

## <a id='update-clusters'></a> Update Cluster Configuration  

After you have deployeed clusters, you can modify their configuration when they are in the Running state.

1. Select a cluster in the **Clusters** tab and click **Update**.

1. Optionally update the number of worker nodes, change the network or Kubernetes profile, or expand **Advanced Settings** to update the settings for node drain and the pod shutdown grace period.

## <a id='upgrade-clusters'></a> Upgrade Clusters to a New Version of Kubernetes

If you make a new version of Kubernetes available by upgrading <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console, you can upgrade your existing clusters in the management console.

1. Go to the **TKG Integrated Edition** view of the management console.
1. Select the **Clusters** tab.
1. Select one or more clusters and click **Upgrade**.

    Clusters must be in the running state for upgrade to be possible.

## <a id='delete-clusters'></a> Delete Clusters
    
To delete a cluster that you no longer require, select it in the **Clusters** tab and click **Delete**.
