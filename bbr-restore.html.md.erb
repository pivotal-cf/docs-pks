This topic describes how to use BOSH Backup and Restore (BBR) to restore
the BOSH Director, <%= vars.product_full %> control plane, and Kubernetes clusters.

##<a id="overview"></a> Overview

In the event of a disaster, you may lose your environment's VMs, disks, and your IaaS network and load balancer resources as well.
You can re-create your environment, configured with your saved <%= vars.product_short %> Ops Manager Installation settings,
using your BBR backup artifacts.

Before restoring using BBR:  

* Review the requirements listed in [Compatibility of Restore](#compatibility)
below.
* Complete all of the steps documented in
[Preparing to Restore a Backup](#preparing-backup) below.

<br>
Use BBR to restore the following:

* The BOSH Director plane, see
[Restore the BOSH Director](#redeploy-restore-director) below.
* The <%= vars.product_short %> control plane, see
[Restore <%= vars.product_short %> Control Plane](#redeploy-restore-control-plane)
below.
* The <%= vars.product_short %> clusters, see
[Restore <%= vars.product_short %> Clusters](#redeploy-restore-clusters)
below.

## <a id="compatibility"></a> Compatibility of Restore  

The following are the requirements for a backup artifact to be restorable to another environment:  

* **Topology**: BBR requires the BOSH topology of a deployment to be the same in the restore 
environment as it was in the backup environment.  
* **Naming of instance groups and jobs**: For any deployment that implements the backup and restore 
scripts, the instance groups and jobs must have the same names.  
* **Number of instance groups and jobs**: For instance groups and jobs that have backup and restore scripts, the same number of instances must exist.  

Additional considerations:  

* **Limited validation**: BBR puts the backed up data into the corresponding instance groups and 
jobs in the restored environment, but cannot validate the restore beyond that.  
* **Same Cluster**: Currently, BBR supports the in-place restore of a cluster backup artifact onto the same cluster. 
Migration from one cluster to another using a BBR backup artifact has not yet been validated.  

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> This section is for guidance only. You should always validate your
backups by using the backup artifacts in a restore.
</p>

<%= partial 'preparing-for-bbr' %>  
<p>
</p>

## <a id="artifacts-jumpbox"></a> Transfer Artifacts to Your Jumpbox

To restore BOSH director, <%= vars.product_short %> control plane or cluster you must transfer your BBR backup artifacts from your safe storage location to your jumpbox.

1. To copy an artifact onto a jumpbox, run the following SCP command:

    ```
    scp -r LOCAL-PATH-TO-BACKUP-ARTIFACT JUMPBOX-USER@JUMPBOX-ADDRESS:
    ```

    Where:  
    * `LOCAL-PATH-TO-BACKUP-ARTIFACT` is the path to your BBR backup artifact.
    * `JUMPBOX-USER` is the ssh username of the jumpbox.
    * `JUMPBOX-ADDRESS` is the IP address, or hostname, of the jumpbox.

1. (Optional) Decrypt your backup artifact if the artifact is encrypted.

## <a id="redeploy-restore-director"></a> Restore the BOSH Director

In the event of losing your BOSH Director or Ops Manager environment, you must first recreate the BOSH Director VM 
before restoring the BOSH Director.

You can restore your BOSH Director configuration by using <%= vars.product_short %> 
Ops Manager to restore the installation settings artifacts saved when following the [Export Installation Settings](bbr-backup.html#export-opsman-settings) backup procedure steps.

To redeploy and restore your Ops Manager and BOSH Director follow the procedures below.

### <a id='deploy-opsmanager'></a> Deploy Ops Manager

In the event of a disaster, you may lose your IaaS resources. You must recreate your IaaS resources before restoring using your BBR artifacts.  

1. To recreate your IaaS resources, such as networks and load balancers, prepare your 
environment for <%= vars.product_short %> by following the installation instructions 
specific to your IaaS in [Installing <%= vars.product_short %>](installing.html).

1. After recreating IaaS resources, you must add those resources to Ops Manager 
by performing the procedures in the [(Optional) Configure Ops Manager for New Resources](#config-new-resources) section.

### <a id='import-settings'></a>Import Installation Settings

<p class="note warning">
<strong>WARNING:</strong> After importing installation settings, do not click <strong>Apply Changes</strong> 
in Ops Manager before instructed to in the steps <a href="#deploy-bosh-director">Deploy the BOSH Director</a> or
<a href="#redeploy-restore-control-plane">Redeploy the <%= vars.product_short %> 
Control Plane</a>.
</p>

You can import installation settings in two ways:

* Use the Ops Manager UI:
    1. Access your new Ops Manager by navigating to `YOUR-OPS-MAN-FQDN` in a browser.
    1. On the **Welcome to Ops Manager** page, click **Import Existing Installation**.
    1. In the import panel, perform the following tasks:
        * Enter the **Decryption Passphrase** in use when you exported the installation settings from Ops Manager.
        * Click **Choose File** and browse to the installation zip file that you exported in [Back Up Installation Settings](bbr-backup.html#export-opsman-settings).
    1. Click **Import**.
        <p class="note">
        <strong>Note:</strong> Some browsers do not provide the import process progress status, and may appear to hang.
        The import process takes at least 10 minutes, and requires additional time for each restored Ops Manager tile.
        </p>
    1. **Successfully imported installation** is displayed upon successful completion of importing all installation settings.

* Use the Ops Manager API:
    1. To use the Ops Manager API to import installation settings, run the following command:

        ```
        curl "https://OPS-MAN-FQDN/api/v0/installation_asset_collection" \
        -X POST \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN" \
        -F 'installation[file]=@installation.zip' \
        -F 'passphrase=DECRYPTION-PASSPHRASE'
        ```
        Where:
        * `OPS-MAN-FQDN` is the fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) for your Ops Manager deployment.  
        * `UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN` is the UAA access token. For more information about how to retrieve this token, 
        see [Using the Ops Manager API](https://docs.pivotal.io/ops-manager/install/ops-man-api.html).  
        * `DECRYPTION-PASSPHRASE` is the decryption passphrase in use when you exported the installation 
        settings from Ops Manager.  


### <a id="config-new-resources"></a> (Optional) Configure Ops Manager for New Resources

If you recreated IaaS resources such as networks and load balancers by following the steps in the 
[Deploy Ops Manager](#deploy-opsmanager) section above, perform the following steps to update Ops Manager with your new resources:

1. Enable Ops Manager advanced mode. For more information, see 
[How to Enable Advanced Mode in the Ops Manager](https://community.pivotal.io/s/article/How-to-Enable-Advanced-Mode-in-the-Ops-Manager) 
in the Knowledge Base.
  <p class="note">
  <strong>Note:</strong> Ops Manager advanced mode allows you to make changes that are normally disabled. 
  You may see warning messages when you save changes.
  </p>

1. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click the BOSH Director tile.

1. If you are using Google Cloud Platform (GCP), click **Google Config** and update:
    1. **Project ID** to reflect the GCP project ID.
    1. **Default Deployment Tag** to reflect the environment name.
    1. **AuthJSON** to reflect the service account.

1. Click **Create Networks** and update the network names to reflect the network names for the new environment.

1. If your BOSH Director had an external hostname, you must change it in **Director Config > Director Hostname** 
to ensure it does not conflict with the hostname of the backed up Director.

1. Ensure that there are no outstanding warning messages in the BOSH Director tile, then disable Ops Manager advanced mode. 
For more information, see [How to Enable Advanced Mode in the Ops Manager](https://community.pivotal.io/s/article/How-to-Enable-Advanced-Mode-in-the-Ops-Manager) 
in the Knowledge Base.

<p class="note">
<strong>Note</strong>: A change in VM size or underlying hardware should not affect the ability for BBR 
restore data, as long as adequate storage space to restore the data exists.
</p>

### <a id="bosh-state"></a> Remove BOSH State File

1. SSH into your Ops Manager VM. For more information, see the 
[Log in to the Ops Manager VM with SSH](https://docs.pivotal.io/ops-manager/install/trouble-advanced.html#ssh) 
section of the _Advanced Troubleshooting with the BOSH CLI_ topic.

1. To delete the `/var/tempest/workspaces/default/deployments/bosh-state.json` file, run the following on the Ops Manager VM:

    ```bash
    sudo rm /var/tempest/workspaces/default/deployments/bosh-state.json
    ```

1. In a browser, navigate to your Ops Manager's fully-qualified domain name.
1. Log in to Ops Manager.

### <a id="deploy-bosh-director"></a> Deploy the BOSH Director

You can deploy the BOSH Director by itself in two ways:

* Use the Ops Manager UI:
    1. Open the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard.  
    1. Click  **Review Pending Changes**.  
    1. On the Review Pending Changes page, click the **BOSH Director** checkbox.  
    1. Click **Apply Changes**.    

* Use the Ops Manager API:
    1. Use the Ops Manager API to deploy the BOSH Director.

### <a id='restore-director'></a> Restore the BOSH Director

Restore the BOSH Director by running BBR commands on your jumpbox.

To restore the BOSH Director:  

1. Ensure the <%= vars.product_short %> BOSH Director backup artifact is in the folder from which you run BBR.

1. Run the BBR restore command to restore the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> BOSH Director:

    ```
    nohup bbr director  --host BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP \
    --username bbr  --private-key-path PRIVATE-KEY-FILE \
    restore \
    --artifact-path PATH-TO-DIRECTOR-BACKUP
    ```

    Where:
    * `BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP` is the address of the BOSH Director. If the BOSH Director is public, BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP is a URL, 
    such as `https://my-bosh.xxx.cf-app.com`. Otherwise, this is the internal IP `BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP` which you can 
    retrieve as shown in [Retrieve the BOSH Director Address](#bosh-address).  
    * `PRIVATE-KEY-FILE` is the path to the private key file that you can create from `Bbr Ssh Credentials` as shown in 
    [Download the BBR SSH Credentials](#bbr-ssh-creds).  
    * `PATH-TO-DEPLOYMENT-BACKUP` is the path to the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> BOSH Director backup that you want to restore.  

    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ nohup bbr director  --host 10.0.0.5 \
      --username bbr  --private-key-path private.pem \
      restore \
      --artifact-path /home/10.0.0.5-abcd1234abcd1234
    </pre>
    <p class="note">
    <strong>Note</strong>: The BBR restore command can take a long time to complete. 
    The example command in this section uses <code>nohup</code> and the restore process is run within your SSH session. 
    If you instead run the BBR command in a <code>screen</code> or <code>tmux</code> session the task will 
    run separately from your SSH session and will continue to run, even if your SSH connection to the jumpbox fails.
    </p>
1. If your BOSH Director restore fails, do one or more of the following:
    * Run the command again, adding the `--debug` flag to enable debug logs. For more information,
      see [BBR Logging](bbr-logging.html).
    * Follow the steps in [Resolve a Failing BBR Restore Command](#recover-from-failing-command) below.  

    Be sure to complete the steps in [Clean Up After a Failed Restore](#manual-clean) below.  

### <a id='remove-stale-cloud-ids'></a> Remove All Stale Deployment Cloud IDs

After BOSH Director has been restored, you must reconcile BOSH Director's internal state with the state of the IaaS.

1. To determine the existing deployments in your environment, run the following command:

    ```
    BOSH-CLI-CREDENTIALS bosh deployments
    ```

    Where:
    * `BOSH-CLI-CREDENTIALS` is the full `Bosh Commandline Credentials` value that you copied from the BOSH Director tile in [Download the BOSH Commandline Credentials](#bosh-cli-creds).

1. To reconcile the BOSH Director's internal state with the state of a single deployment, run the following command:

    ```
    BOSH-CLI-CREDENTIALS bosh -d DEPLOYMENT-NAME -n cck \
    --resolution delete_disk_reference \
    --resolution delete_vm_reference
    ```

    Where:
    * `BOSH-CLI-CREDENTIALS` is the full `Bosh Commandline Credentials` value that you copied from the BOSH Director tile in [Download the BOSH Commandline Credentials](#bosh-cli-creds).
    * `DEPLOYMENT-NAME` is a deployment name retrieved in the previous step.
1. Repeat the last command for each deployment in the IaaS.

## <a id='redeploy-restore-control-plane'></a> Restore the <%= vars.product_short %> Control Plane

You must redeploy the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile before restoring the <%= vars.product_short %> control plane. 
By redeploying the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile you create the VMs that constitute the control plane deployment.

To redeploy the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile, do the following:  

* [Determine the Required Stemcell](#determine-stemcell) needed by the tile.  
* Upload that stemcell as described in [Upload Stemcells](#upload-stemcell).  
* [Redeploy the <%= vars.product_short %> Control Plane](#redeploy-control-plane).  
* [Restore the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Control Plane](#restore-control-plane) from a BBR backup on top of the deployment.  

### <a id='determine-stemcell'></a> Determine the Required Stemcell

Do either the following procedures to determine the stemcell that <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> uses:

* Review the Stemcell Library:
    1. Open Ops Manager.
    1. Click **Stemcell Library**.
    1. Record the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> stemcell release number from the **Staged** column.

* Review a Stemcell List Using BOSH CLI:
    1. To retrieve the stemcell release using the BOSH CLI, run the following command:

        ```
        BOSH-CLI-CREDENTIALS bosh deployments
        ```
        Where:
        * `BOSH-CLI-CREDENTIALS`  is the full `Bosh Commandline Credentials` value that you copied from the BOSH Director tile in [Download the BOSH Commandline Credentials](#bosh-cli-creds).  

        For example:
        <pre class="terminal">
        $ bosh deployments
        Using environment '10.0.0.5' as user 'director' (bosh.\*.read, openid, bosh.\*.admin, bosh.read, bosh.admin)

        Name                                                   Release(s)                                 Stemcell(s)                                    Team(s)
        pivotal-container-service-453f2faa3bd2e16f52b7         backup-and-restore-sdk/1.9.0               bosh-google-kvm-ubuntu-xenial-go_agent/170.15  -
        ...
        </pre>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> At most, the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> tile can have two
    stemcells, where one stemcell is Linux and the other stemcell is Windows.
</p>

For more information about stemcells in Ops Manager, see [Importing and Managing Stemcells](https://docs.pivotal.io/ops-manager/opsguide/managing-stemcells.html).  

### <a id='upload-stemcell'></a> Upload Stemcells

To upload the stemcell used by your <%= vars.product_tile %> tile:  

1. Download the stemcell from [VMware Tanzu Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/stemcells).
1. Run the following command to upload the stemcell used by <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>:

    ```
    BOSH-CLI-CREDENTIALS  bosh -d DEPLOYMENT-NAME \
    --ca-cert PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERTIFICATE \
    upload-stemcell \
    --fix PATH-TO-STEMCELL
    ```
    Where:
    * `BOSH-CLI-CREDENTIALS`  is the full `Bosh Commandline Credentials` value that you copied 
    from the BOSH Director tile in [Download the BOSH Commandline Credentials](#bosh-cli-creds).  
    * `PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERTIFICATE` is the path to the root CA certificate that you 
    downloaded in [Download the Root CA Certificate](#root-ca-cert).  
    * `PATH-TO-STEMCELL` is the path to your tile's stemcell.  

1. To ensure the stemcells for all of your other installed tiles have been uploaded,
repeat the last step, running the `bosh upload-stemcell --fix PATH-TO-STEMCELL` command,
for each required stemcell that is different from the already uploaded <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> stemcell.

### <a id='redeploy-control-plane'></a> Redeploy the <%= vars.product_short %> Control Plane

To redeploy your <%= vars.product_tile %> tile's control plane:  

1. From the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard, navigate to **VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition** > **Resource Config**. 

1. Ensure the **Upgrade all clusters** errand is **Off**.  

1. Ensure both **Instances** > **<%= vars.control_plane %>** and 
**Instances** > **<%= vars.control_plane_db %>** are configured as they had been 
when the backup you are restoring was created.  

1. Ensure that all errands needed by your system are set to run.

1. Return to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard.

1. Click **Review Pending Changes**.

1. Review your changes. For more information, see [Reviewing Pending Product Changes](https://docs.pivotal.io/ops-manager/install/review-pending-changes.html).

        1. Deploy the cluster:

            ```
            bosh -d DEPLOYMENT-NAME deploy YOUR-DEPLOYMENT-MANIFEST.yml
            ```
            Where:
            * `DEPLOYMENT-NAME` is the name of your Kubernetes cluster deployment.
            * `YOUR-DEPLOYMENT-MANIFEST` is the name of your Kubernetes cluster deployment manifest.
        1. Run all errands needed for your cluster:

            ```
            bosh -d DEPLOYMENT-NAME run-errand ERRAND-NAME
            ```

            Where:
            * `DEPLOYMENT-NAME` is the name of your Kubernetes cluster deployment.
            * `ERRAND-NAME` is the name of the errand you want to run.
            To list errands available in your deployment, use the `bosh errands` command.

            For example:

            <pre class="terminal">
            bosh -d service-instance_8de000ff-a87a-4930-81ba-106d42c2471e run-errand apply-addons
            </pre>
%>

### <a id='restore-clusters'></a> Restore Clusters

After redeploying your <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>-provisioned clusters, restore their stateless workloads and cluster state from backup by running the BOSH `restore` command from your jumpbox.
Stateless workloads are tracked in the cluster etcd database, which BBR backs up.

<p class="note warning">
<strong>Warning:</strong> BBR does not back up persistent volumes, load balancers, or other IaaS resources.</p>

<p class="note warning">
<strong>Warning:</strong> When you restore a cluster, etcd is stopped in the API server.
During this process, only currently-deployed clusters function, and you cannot create new workloads.
</p>

To restore a cluster:  

1. Move the cluster backup artifact to a folder from which you will run the BBR restore process.

1. SSH into your jumpbox. For more information about the jumpbox, see 
[Configure Your Jumpbox](bbr-install.html#jumpbox-setup) in _Installing BOSH Backup and Restore_.

1. Run the following command:

    ```
    BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET=BOSH-CLIENT-SECRET \
    nohup bbr deployment  --target BOSH-TARGET \
    --username BOSH-CLIENT  --deployment DEPLOYMENT-NAME \

1. To cancel a running `bbr restore`, see [Cancel a Restore](#cancel-restore) below.
1. After you restore a Kubernetes cluster, you must register its workers with their control plane nodes by following the [Register Restored Worker VMs](#register-nodes) steps below.
1. If your <%= vars.product_short %> cluster restore fails, do one or more of the following:
    * Run the command again, adding the `--debug` flag to enable debug logs. For more information,
      see [BBR Logging](bbr-logging.html).
    * Follow the steps in [Resolve a Failing BBR Restore Command](#recover-from-failing-command) below.  

    Be sure to complete the steps in [Clean Up After a Failed Restore](#manual-clean) below.  

## <a id='register-nodes'></a> Register Restored Worker VMs

After restoring a Kubernetes cluster, 
you must register all of the cluster's worker nodes with their control plane nodes. 
To register cluster worker nodes, complete the following:  

1. [Delete Nodes](#delete-nodes)
1. [Restart kubelet](#restart-kubelet)  

### <a id='delete-nodes'></a> Delete Nodes

To delete a cluster's restored nodes:  

1. To determine your cluster's namespace, run the following command:

    ```
    kubectl get all --all-namespaces
    ```

1. To retrieve the list of worker nodes in the cluster, run the following command:  

    ```
    kubectl get nodes -o wide
    ```
    Document the worker node names listed in the `NAME` column. 
    The worker nodes should all be listed with a status of `NotReady`.  
1. To delete a node, run the following:  

    ```
    kubectl delete node NODE-NAME
    ```
    Where `NODE-NAME` is a node `NAME` returned by the `kubectl get nodes` command.  

1. Repeat the preceding `kubectl delete node` step for each of your cluster's nodes.

### <a id='restart-kubelet'></a> Restart kubelet

To restart `kubelet` on your worker node VMs:  

1. To restart `kubelet` on all of your cluster's worker node VMs, run the following command:

    ```
    bosh ssh -d DEPLOYMENT-NAME worker -c 'sudo /var/vcap/bosh/bin/monit restart kubelet'
    ```
    Where `DEPLOYMENT-NAME` is the cluster BOSH deployment name that you recorded in 
    [Retrieve Your Cluster Deployment Names](#cluster-deployment-name) above.    

1. To confirm all worker nodes in your cluster have been restored to a `Ready` state, 
run the following command:

    ```
    kubectl get nodes -o wide
    ```


## <a id="recover-from-failing-command"></a>Resolve a Failing BBR Restore Command

To resolve a failing BBR restore command:

1. Ensure that you set all the parameters in the command.
1. Ensure that the BOSH Director credentials are valid.
1. Ensure that the specified BOSH deployment or Director exists.
1. Ensure that the jumpbox can reach the BOSH Director.
1. Ensure the source backup artifact is compatible with the target BOSH deployment or Director.
1. If you see the error message `Directory /var/vcap/store/bbr-backup already exists on instance`,
run the relevant commands from the [Clean up After Failed Restore](#manual-clean) section of this
topic.
1. See the [BBR Logging](bbr-logging.html) topic.

## <a id='cancel-restore'></a>Cancel a Restore

If you must cancel a restore, perform the following steps:

1. Terminate the BBR process by pressing Ctrl-C and typing `yes` to confirm.
1. Perform the procedures in the [Clean up After Failed Restore](#manual-clean) section to enable future restores. Stopping a restore can leave the system in an unusable state and prevent future restores.

## <a id="manual-clean"></a>Clean Up After a Failed Restore

If a BBR restore process fails, BBR may not have run the post-restore scripts, potentially leaving the instance in a locked state. 
Additionally, the BBR restore folder may remain on the target instance and subsequent restore attempts may also fail.  

* To resolve issues following a failed BOSH Director restore, run the following BBR command:

    ```
    nohup bbr director \
    --host BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP \
    --username bbr \
    --private-key-path PRIVATE-KEY-FILE \
    restore-cleanup
    ```

    Where:  
    * `BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP` is the address of the BOSH Director. If the BOSH Director is public, 
    BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP is a URL, such as `https://my-bosh.xxx.cf-app.com`. Otherwise, this is the internal IP `BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP` 
    which you can retrieve as show in [Retrieve the BOSH Director Address](#bosh-address) above.  
    * `PRIVATE-KEY-FILE` is the path to the private key file that you can create from `Bbr Ssh Credentials` 
    as shown in [Download the BBR SSH Credentials](#bbr-ssh-creds) above.  
    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ nohup bbr director \
    --target 10.0.0.5 \
    --username bbr \
    --private-key-path private.pem \
    restore-cleanup
    </pre>

* To resolve issues following a failed control plane restore, run the following BBR command:

    ```
    BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET=BOSH-CLIENT-SECRET \
    bbr deployment \
    --target BOSH-TARGET \
    --username BOSH-CLIENT \
    --deployment DEPLOYMENT-NAME \
    --ca-cert PATH-TO-BOSH-CA-CERT \
    restore-cleanup
    ```

    Where:
    * `BOSH-CLIENT-SECRET` is the value for `BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET` retrieved in [Download the BOSH Commandline Credentials](#bosh-cli-creds) above.
    * `BOSH-TARGET` is the value for `BOSH_ENVIRONMENT` retrieved in [Download the BOSH Commandline Credentials](#bosh-cli-creds) above.
        You must be able to reach the target address from the workstation where you run `bbr` commands.
    * `BOSH-CLIENT` is the value for `BOSH_CLIENT` retrieved in [Download the BOSH Commandline Credentials](#bosh-cli-creds) above.  
    * `DEPLOYMENT-NAME` is the name retrieved in [Retrieve Your Cluster Deployment Name](#cluster-deployment-name) above.   
    * `PATH-TO-BOSH-CA-CERT` is the path to the root CA certificate that you downloaded in [Download the Root CA Certificate](#root-ca-cert) above.  
    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ BOSH\_CLIENT\_SECRET=p455w0rd \
    bbr deployment \
    --target bosh.example.com \
    --username admin \
    --deployment pivotal-container-service-453f2f \
    --ca-cert bosh.ca.crt \
    restore-cleanup
    </pre>

* To resolve issues following a failed cluster restore, run the following BBR command:

    ```
    BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET=BOSH-CLIENT-SECRET \
    bbr deployment \
    --target BOSH-TARGET \
    --username BOSH-CLIENT \
    --deployment DEPLOYMENT-NAME \
    --ca-cert PATH-TO-BOSH-CA-CERT \
    restore-cleanup
    ```

    Where:
    * `BOSH-CLIENT-SECRET` is the value for `BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET` retrieved in [Download the BOSH Commandline Credentials](#bosh-cli-creds).
    * `BOSH-TARGET` is the value for `BOSH_ENVIRONMENT` retrieved in [Download the BOSH Commandline Credentials](#bosh-cli-creds).
        You must be able to reach the target address from the workstation where you run `bbr` commands.
    * `BOSH-CLIENT` is the value for `BOSH_CLIENT` retrieved in [Download the BOSH Commandline Credentials](#bosh-cli-creds).  
    * `DEPLOYMENT-NAME` is the name retrieved in [Retrieve Your Cluster Deployment Names](#cluster-deployment-name) above.   
    * `PATH-TO-BOSH-CA-CERT` is the path to the root CA certificate that you downloaded in [Download the Root CA Certificate](#root-ca-cert).  
    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ BOSH\_CLIENT\_SECRET=p455w0rd \
    bbr deployment \
    --target bosh.example.com \
    --username admin \
    --deployment pivotal-container-service-453f2f \
    --ca-cert bosh.ca.crt \
