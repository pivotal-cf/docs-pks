This topic describes the firewall ports and protocols requirements for using VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition (TKGI)
on vSphere with NSX integration.  

If you are not using TKGI on vSphere with NSX, see one of the follow topics instead:

* [Firewall Ports and Protocols Requirements for vSphere (Antrea and Flannel Networking)](ports-protocols-wo-nsx-t.html)  
* [Firewall Ports and Protocols Requirements (Antrea and Flannel Networking)](ports-protocols-antrea.html)

## <a id="overview"></a> Overview

Apps frequently require the ability to pass internal communication between system components on 
different networks.  

Firewalls and Kubernetes Pod Security Admission are used to filter traffic and limit access in environments with strict 
inter-network access control policies and your apps require one or more conduits through a secured environment's firewalls. 

<%= vars.recommended_by %> recommends that 
rather than using a Kubernetes Pod Security Admission to filter traffic between networks and 
TKGI system components and clusters that you instead use one of the following methods:  

* Enable access to apps through standard Kubernetes load-balancers and ingress
controller types. This enables you to designate specific ports and protocols as a firewall conduit.  
* Enable access using the NSX load balancer and ingress. This enables you to configure external addresses and ports 
that are automatically mapped and resolved to internal/local addresses and ports.

For more information about vSphere with NSX port and protocol requirements, see 
[VMware Ports and Protocols](https://ports.vmware.com/home/vSphere+NSX-Data-Center-for-vSphere+NSX-Data-Center)
on the VMware site.  

Consult the following tables when configuring port settings to install or upgrade TKGI 
or configure a Kubernetes cluster:

* [TKGI Users Ports and Protocols](#users)  
* [TKGI Core Ports and Protocols](#core)  
* [VMware Virtual Infrastructure Ports and Protocols](#virtual-infra)  
* [VMware Optional Integration Ports and Protocols](#optional-integration)  

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: To control which groups access deploying and scaling 
your organization's Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition-deployed Kubernetes clusters, configure your firewall settings 
as described on the Operator â€“> TKGI API server lines below.</p>
