VMware <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console is provided as an OVA template that requires at a minimum the vSphere resources described in [Virtual Infrastructure Prerequisites](console-prereqs-vsphere.html).

## <a id='network-configurations'></a>Network Configurations

<%= vars.product_short %> Management Console provides 3 network configuration options for your <%= vars.product_short %> deployments. Each network configuration option has specific prerequisites. 

- **Bring your own topology**: Deploy <%= vars.product_short %> to an existing NSX-T Data Center network that you have fully configured yourself. See [Prerequisites for a Bring Your Own Topology Deployment to NSX-T Data Center](console-prereqs-nsxt-byot.html).
- **Automated NAT deployment**: Deploy <%= vars.product_short %> to an existing NSX-T Data Center network that you have not fully set up, that <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console helps to configure for you. See [Prerequisites for an Automated NAT Deployment to NSX-T Data Center](console-prereqs-nsxt-automatednat.html).
- **Flannel**: Deploy <%= vars.product_short %> to a Flannel network that <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console provisions for you. See [Prerequisites for a Flannel Network](console-prereqs-flannel.html).

For the list of firewall ports that must be open for an <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console deployment, see [Firewall Ports and Protocols Requirements for Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition Management Console](console-ports-protocols.html).

When your environment meets the prerequisites for vSphere and for your chosen type of networking, you can [Deploy the <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console Appliance](console-deploy-ova.html).
 
## <a id='when-to-use-console'></a>When Should I Use <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console?

<%= vars.product_short %> Management Console greatly simplifies the process of deploying <%= vars.product_short %>, especially in less complex environments. However, if you require more flexibility in in configuring your deployment, especially in complex NSX-T Data Center deployments, it might be more appropriate to perform the installation manually. For information about the supported topologies for a manual installation, see [NSX-T Deployment Topologies for Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition](./nsxt-topologies.html).

Before using <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console to deploy <%= vars.product_short %>, consider the following factors:

- If you want to deploy <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console to a No-NAT topology with an NSX-T Data Center logical switch, you must perform a BYOT deployment.
- Deployments to a [Multi-Tier-0](./nsxt-multi-t0.html) topology are supported in BYOT deployments only and require additional configuration. For information about the additional configuration required, see [Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition Management Console Cannot Retrieve Cluster Data in a Multi-Tier0 Topology](console-troubleshooting.html#multi-T0-deployments) in *Troubleshooting Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition Management Console*.
- Deployments to a No-NAT topology with a vSphere Standard Switch or a vSphere Distributed Switch are not supported in any case.
- [Multi-Foundation](.//nsxt-multi.html) deployments are not supported in any case.
