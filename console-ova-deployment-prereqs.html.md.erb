This topic describes the prerequisites for deploying and using <%= vars.product_full %> Management Console (<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> MC).  


<br>
<br>
## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

Review the following prerequisites and requirements before deploying and using <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> MC in your environment:  

* **VMware vSphere Requirements**: VMware <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Management Console is provided as an OVA template that requires at a minimum the vSphere resources described in [Virtual Infrastructure Prerequisites](console-prereqs-vsphere.html).  
* **Network Configurations Requirements**: VMware <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Management Console requires specific network configurations and open Firewall ports. for more information, see [Network Configurations Requirements](#network-configurations) below.  

For more information, see [When Should I Use <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console?](./vsphere-index.html#when-to-use-console)

<br>
<br>
## <a id='network-configurations'></a>Network Configurations Requirements

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Management Console provides three network configuration options for your <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> deployments. Each network configuration option has specific prerequisites. 

Supported network configurations:  

* **Bring your own topology**: Deploy <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> to an existing NSX-T Data Center network that you have fully configured yourself. See [Prerequisites for a Bring Your Own Topology Deployment to NSX-T Data Center](console-prereqs-nsxt-byot.html).
* **Automated NAT deployment**: Deploy <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> to an existing NSX-T Data Center network that you have not fully set up, that <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console helps to configure for you. See [Prerequisites for an Automated NAT Deployment to NSX-T Data Center](console-prereqs-nsxt-automatednat.html).
* **vSphere Without NSX-T**: Deploy <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> to vSphere without an NSX-T network that <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console provisions for you. See [Prerequisites for vSphere Without an NSX-T Network](console-prereqs-flannel.html).

Firewall port requirements:  

* For the list of firewall ports that must be open for <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Management Console deployments, see [Firewall Ports and Protocols Requirements for Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition Management Console](console-ports-protocols.html).
