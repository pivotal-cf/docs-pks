To manage your PKS deployment with BOSH, perform the following steps:

1. Gather credential and IP address information for your BOSH Director and SSH into the Ops Manager VM.
See [Advanced Troubleshooting with the BOSH CLI](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/trouble-advanced.html) for more information.
1. Create a BOSH alias for your PKS environment. For example:
  <pre class="terminal">$ bosh alias-env pks -e 10.0.0.3 \
  --ca-cert /var/tempest/workspaces/default/root_ca_certificate</pre>
1. Log in to the BOSH Director.
  <pre class="terminal">$ bosh -e pks log-in</pre>
1. Follow the procedures in the [Use the BOSH CLI for Troubleshooting](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/trouble-advanced.html#cli) topic to manage your PKS deployment with BOSH.
