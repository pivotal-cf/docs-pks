title: Configuring the Upgrade Pipeline
owner: TKGI
---

This topic describes how to set up a Concourse pipeline to perform automatic upgrades of a <%= vars.product_full %> installation.

When you configure the upgrade pipeline, the pipeline upgrades your installation when a new <%= vars.product_short %> release becomes available on VMware Tanzu Network.

By default, the pipeline upgrades when a new major patch version is available.

For more information about configuring and using Concourse for continuous integration (CI), see the [Concourse documentation](https://concourse-ci.org/index.html).

## <a id="download"></a> Download the Upgrade Pipeline

Perform the following steps:

1. From a browser, log in to [VMware Tanzu Network](https://network.pivotal.io/).

1. Navigate to the **Platform Automation Tools** product page to download the upgrade-tile pipeline.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you cannot access Platform Automation Tools on VMware Tanzu Network, contact Support.</p>

1. (Optional) Edit [params.yml](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/pcf-pipelines/blob/v0.23.0/upgrade-tile/params.yml) to configure the pipeline.
  * For example, edit the `product_version_regex` value to follow minor version updates.

1. Set the pipeline using the `fly` CLI for Concourse. See the [upgrade-tile pipeline documentation](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/pcf-pipelines/tree/v0.23.0/upgrade-tile) for more information.

## <a id="configure-pipeline"></a>Configure Automated Ops Manager and Ubuntu Jammy Stemcell Downloading

If you use an automated pipeline to upgrade <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>, 
you must configure your pipeline to download only Ops Manager and Ubuntu Jammy Stemcell versions 
that are compatible with your version of <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>.

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> <%= vars.recommended_by %> recommends that you 
review the Tanzu Network metadata for your version of <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> 
and confirm Ops Manager and stemcell version compatibility before using 
the Tanzu Network APIs to update Ops Manager and Ubuntu Jammy Stemcells in your automated pipeline. 
</p>

To configure your automated <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> upgrade pipeline:

1. To retrieve the Ops Manager and Ubuntu Jammy Stemcell versions compatible with your <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> version:

    ```
    curl -X GET https://network.tanzu.vmware.com/api/v2/products/pivotal-container-service/releases/RELEASE-ID/dependencies
    ```

    Where `RELEASE-ID` is the VMware Tanzu Network ID for your <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> version. 
    You can see the `RELEASE-ID` in the VMware Tanzu Network URL for your <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> version.  
<br>
    For example:  
<br>
    The following example returns the versions of <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> dependencies that are compatible with <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.16:  

    <pre class="terminal">
    curl -X GET https://network.tanzu.vmware.com/api/v2/products/pivotal-container-service/releases/1223878/dependencies

    {
       "dependencies":[
          {
             "release":{
	             "id":1224139,
	             "version":"3.0.2",
                "product":{
                   "id":208,
                   "slug":"ops-manager",
                   "name":"VMware Tanzu Operations Manager"
                },
                "_links":{
                   "self":{
                      "href":"https://network.tanzu.vmware.com/api/v2/products/ops-manager/releases/1224139"
                   }
                }
             }
          },
          {
             "release":{
                "id":1226281,
                "version":"1.75",
                "product":{
                   "id":206,
                   "slug":"stemcells-ubuntu-jammy",
                   "name":"Pivotal Stemcells (Ubuntu Jammy)"
                },
                "_links":{
                   "self":{
                      "href":"https://network.tanzu.vmware.com/api/v2/products/stemcells-ubuntu-jammy/releases/1226281"
                   }
                }
             }
          }
       ],
       "_links":{
          "self":{
             "href":"https://network.tanzu.vmware.com/api/v2/products/pivotal-container-service/releases/1223878/dependencies"
          }
       }
    }
    </pre>

    The example returned metadata above indicates that <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.16 is compatible with only 
    Ops Manager versions v3.0.2 and Ubuntu Jammy Stemcell version v1.75.  

2. Configure your automated pipeline to upgrade to 
only a component version specified in the returned metadata for your version of <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>.

For more information on retrieving <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> dependencies, 
see [API reference](https://network.pivotal.io/docs/api#release_dependencies) 
in the VMware Tanzu Network documentation.
