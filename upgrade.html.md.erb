This section describes the steps required to upgrade to <%= vars.product_short %> v1.13:

1. [Upgrade Ops Manager](#upgrade-opsman)
1. [Download and Import <%= vars.product_short %> v1.13](#upgrade-tile)
1. [Download and Import Stemcells](#stemcell)
1. [Modify Plan CNI Configuration](#modify-cni)
1. [Verify Errand Configuration](#errands)
1. [Verify Other Configurations](#final-review)
1. [Apply Changes to the <%= vars.product_tile %> Tile](#apply-changes)  


<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: When upgrading <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> to mitigate the Apache Log4j vulnerability
you must also upgrade all <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> clusters.
</p>  

### <a id="upgrade-opsman"></a>Upgrade Ops Manager

Each version of <%= vars.product_short %> is compatible with multiple versions of Ops Manager.

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> If you use an automated pipeline to upgrade <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>, 
see <a href="upgrade-pipeline.html#configure-pipeline">Configure Automated Ops Manager and 
Xenial Stemcell Downloading</a> in <em>Configuring the Upgrade Pipeline</em>.  
</p> 

To determine Ops Manager compatibility and, if necessary, upgrade Ops Manager:

1. See [<%= vars.product_network %>](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-container-service)
to determine if your Ops Manager version is compatible with <%= vars.product_short %> v1.13.
1. If your Ops Manager version is not compatible with <%= vars.product_short %> v1.13,
follow the steps below.
1. Upgrade Ops Manager. For instructions, see
[Import Installation to Ops Manager v2.10 VM](https://docs.pivotal.io/ops-manager/2-10/install/upgrading-pcf.html#upgrade) in _Upgrading Ops Manager_ in the Ops Manager documentation.

1. <%= partial 'add-clusters-workloads' %>

### <a id="upgrade-tile"></a> Download and Import <%= vars.product_short %> v1.13

When you upgrade <%= vars.product_short %>,
your configuration settings typically migrate to the new version automatically.
To download and import a <%= vars.product_short %> version:

1. Download the desired version of the product
from [<%= vars.product_network %>](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-container-service/).

1. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Import a Product**
to upload the product file.

1. Under the **Import a Product** button, click **+** next to **<%= vars.product_tile %>**.
This adds the tile to your staging area.

### <a id="stemcell"></a> Download and Import Stemcells

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> requires a Xenial stemcell.
A stemcell for Windows 2019 is also required if you intend to create Windows worker-based clusters.
For information about Windows stemcells, see
[Configuring Windows Worker-Based Clusters](windows-workers.html).

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> If you use an automated pipeline to upgrade <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>, 
see <a href="upgrade-pipeline.html#configure-pipeline">Configure Automated Ops Manager 
and Xenial Stemcell Downloading</a> in <em>Configuring the Upgrade Pipeline</em>.  
</p>

If Ops Manager does not have the Xenial stemcell required for <%= vars.product_short %> v1.13,
the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile displays the message **Missing stemcell**.
To download and import a new Xenial stemcell, follow the steps below:

1. On the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile, click the **Missing stemcell** link.

    <img src="images/missing_stemcell.png" alt="Verify stemcell assignment">

1. In the **Stemcell Library**, locate the **<%= vars.product_tile %>** tile and note the required stemcell version.

1. Navigate to the [Stemcells (Ubuntu Xenial)](https://network.pivotal.io/products/stemcells-ubuntu-xenial/) page on <%= vars.product_network %>
and download the required stemcell version for your IaaS.

1. Return to the **Installation Dashboard** in Ops Manager and click **Stemcell Library**.

1. On the **Stemcell Library** page, click **Import Stemcell** and select the stemcell file you downloaded from <%= vars.product_network %>.

1. Select the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile and click **Apply Stemcell to Products**.

1. Verify that Ops Manager successfully applied the stemcell. The stemcell version you imported and applied appears in the **Staged** column for <%= vars.product_tile %>.

1. Return to the **Installation Dashboard**.

### <a id="modify-cni"></a>Modify Container Network Interface Configuration

<%= vars.product_short %> supports using the Antrea Container Network Interface (CNI) as
the CNI for new <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>-provisioned clusters. 

To configure <%= vars.product_short %> to use Antrea as the CNI for new clusters:

1. In the **Installation Dashboard**, click **Networking**.  
1. Under **Container Networking Interface**, select **Antrea**.  
1. Confirm the remaining Container Networking Interface settings.  
1. Click **Save**.  

For more information about <%= vars.product_short %> support for Antrea and Flannel CNIs, see [The Antrea CNI](understanding-upgrades.html#cni) 
in _About Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition Upgrades_.

### <a id="errands"></a>Verify Errand Configuration

To verify your **Errands** pane is correctly configured, do the following:

1. In the **<%= vars.product_tile %>** tile, click **Errands**.

1. Under **Post-Deploy Errands**:
    * Review the **Upgrade all clusters** errand:
        * If you want to upgrade the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile and all your existing Kubernetes clusters simultaneously,
        confirm that **Upgrade all clusters errand** is set to **Default (On)**.
        The errand upgrades all clusters.
        Upgrading <%= vars.product_short %>-provisioned Kubernetes clusters can temporarily interrupt the service
        as described in [Service Interruptions](interruptions.html).
        * If you want to upgrade the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile only and
        then upgrade your existing Kubernetes clusters separately, disable **Upgrade all clusters errand**.
        For more information, see [Upgrading Clusters](upgrade-clusters.html).
        <p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> Disabling the <strong>Upgrade all clusters errand</strong>
        causes the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> version tagged in your Kubernetes clusters to fall behind
        the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile version.
        If you disable the <strong>Upgrade all clusters errand</strong>
        when upgrading the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile,
        you must upgrade all your Kubernetes clusters before the next <%= vars.product_short %>
        upgrade.</p>
    * Configure the **Run smoke tests** errand:
        * Set the **Run smoke tests** errand to **On**.
        The errand uses the <%= vars.product_short %> Command Line Interface (<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> CLI) to create a
        Kubernetes cluster and then delete it. If the creation or deletion fails, the errand fails and
        the installation of the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile is aborted.

1. Click **Save**.

### <a id="final-review"></a>Verify Other Configurations
To confirm your other **<%= vars.product_tile %>** tile panes are correctly configured, do the following:

1. Review the **Assign AZs and Networks** pane.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> When you upgrade <%= vars.product_short %>, you must place singleton jobs in the AZ you selected when you first installed the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile. You cannot move singleton jobs to another AZ.</p>
1. Review the other configuration panes.
1. Make changes where necessary.
<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING</strong>: Do not change the number of control plane/etcd nodes
for any plan that was used to create currently-running clusters.
<%= vars.product_short %> does not support changing the number of control plane/etcd nodes for plans
with existing clusters.
</p>
1. Click **Save** on any panes where you make changes.

### <a id="apply-changes"></a>Apply Changes to the <%= vars.product_tile %> Tile

To complete the upgrade of the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile:

1. Return to the **Installation Dashboard** in Ops Manager.

1. Click **Review Pending Changes**.
     For more information about this Ops Manager page, see
    [Reviewing Pending Product Changes](https://docs.pivotal.io/ops-manager/install/review-pending-changes.html).

1. Click **Apply Changes**.

1. (Optional) To monitor the progress of the **Upgrade all clusters errand** using the BOSH CLI, do the following:
      1. Log in to the BOSH Director by running `bosh -e MY-ENVIRONMENT log-in` from a VM that can access your <%= vars.product_short %> deployment. For more information, see [Using BOSH Diagnostic Commands in <%= vars.product_short %>](diagnostic-tools.html).
      1. Run `bosh -e MY-ENVIRONMENT tasks`.
      1. Locate the task number for the errand in the <strong>&#35;</strong> column of the BOSH output.
      1. Run `bosh task TASK-NUMBER`, replacing `TASK-NUMBER` with the task number you located in the previous step.

## <a id="after-upgrade"></a>After the Upgrade

After you complete the upgrade to <%= vars.product_short %> v1.13,
complete the following verifications and upgrades:

- [Upgrade the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> and Kubernetes CLIs](#upgrade-clis)
- [Verify the Upgrade](#verify-upgrade)

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: When upgrading <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> to mitigate the Apache Log4j vulnerability
you must also upgrade all <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> clusters.
</p>

### <a id="upgrade-clis"></a>Upgrade the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> and Kubernetes CLIs

Upgrade the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> and Kubernetes CLIs on any local machine
where you run commands that interact with your upgraded version of <%= vars.product_short %>.

To upgrade the CLIs, download and re-install the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> and Kubernetes CLI distributions
that are provided with <%= vars.product_short %> on <%= vars.product_network %>.

For more information about installing the CLIs, see the following topics:

* [Installing the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> CLI](installing-cli.html)

* [Installing the Kubernetes CLI](installing-kubectl-cli.html)

### <a id="verify-upgrade"></a>Verify the Upgrade

After you apply changes to the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile and the upgrade is complete,
do the following:

1. Verify that your Kubernetes environment is healthy. To verify the health of your Kubernetes environment, see [Verifying
Deployment Health](./verify-health.html).

    For any cluster upgrade that fails, you can use the BOSH ID of the upgrade task for debugging.
    To retrieve the BOSH task ID,
    see [Retrieve Cluster Upgrade Task ID](./verify-health.html#upgrade-code) in _Verifying Deployment Health_.
