1. (Optional) Configure <%= vars.product_short %> to use a proxy.
<br>
<br>
Production environments can deny direct access to public Internet services and between internal services by placing an HTTP or HTTPS proxy in the network path between Kubernetes nodes and those services.  
<br>
Configure <%= vars.product_short %> to use your proxy and enable the following:  
  * <%= vars.control_plane %> access to public Internet services and other internal services.  
  * <%= vars.product_short %>-deployed Kubernetes nodes access to public Internet services and other internal services.  
  * <%= vars.product_short %> Telemetry ability to forward Telemetry data to the CEIP and Telemetry program.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: This setting does not set the proxy for running Kubernetes workloads or pods.
    </p>
1. To complete your global proxy configuration for all outgoing HTTP/HTTPS traffic from your Kubernetes clusters, perform the following steps:  
    1. To proxy outgoing HTTP traffic, enter the URL of your HTTP proxy endpoint under **HTTP Proxy URL**. 
    For example, `http\://myproxy.com:1234`.
    1. (Optional) If your outgoing HTTP proxy uses basic authentication, 
    enter the username and password in the **HTTP Proxy Credentials** fields.  
    1. To proxy outgoing HTTPS traffic, enter the URL of your HTTP proxy endpoint under **HTTPS Proxy URL**. 
    For example, `http\://myproxy.com:1234`.   
    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Using an HTTPS connection to the proxy server is not supported. 
    HTTP and HTTPS proxy options can only be configured with an HTTP connection to the proxy server. 
    You cannot populate either of the proxy URL fields with an HTTPS URL. The proxy host and port can be different for HTTP and HTTPS traffic, 
    but the proxy protocol must be HTTP.
    </p>
    1. (Optional) If your HTTPS proxy uses basic authentication, 
    enter the username and password in the **HTTPS Proxy Credentials** fields.  
    1. Under **No Proxy**,  enter the comma-separated list of IP addresses that must bypass the proxy to 
    allow for internal <%= vars.product_short %> communication.  
    <br>
    The **No Proxy** list should include `127.0.0.1` and `localhost`.  
    <br>
    Also include the following in the **No Proxy** list:  
        * Your <%= vars.product_short %> environment's CIDRs, such as 
    the service network CIDR where your <%= vars.product_short %> cluster is deployed, 
    the deployment network CIDR, the node network IP block CIDR, and the pod network IP block CIDR.     
    <br>
        * The FQDN of any registry, such as the Harbor API FQDN, or component communicating with <%= vars.product_short %>, using a hostname 
        instead of an IP address.  
    <br>
    <% if current_page.data.topic=="proxies-nsx-t" || current_page.data.iaas == "vSphere" %>
        * The IP addresses for your NSX Manager, vCenter Server, and all ESXi hosts,
        if you are upgrading and have an existing proxy configuration for reaching a Docker registry or 
        other external services.  
    <br>
        * Any additional IP addresses or domain names that should bypass the proxy.      
        <br>
        The **No Proxy** property for vSphere accepts wildcard domains denoted by a prefixed `\*.` or `.`.
        <br><br>
        For example:  
        <pre>
        127.0.0.1,localhost,
        \*.example1.com,
        .example2.com,
        example3.com,
        198.51.100.0/24,
        203.0.113.0/24,
        192.0.2.0/24
        </pre>
        <% else %>
        * Any additional IP addresses or domain names that should bypass the proxy.      
        <br>The **No Proxy** property for AWS accepts wildcard domains denoted by a prefixed `\*.` or `.`.
        <br><br>
        For example:  
        <pre>
        127.0.0.1,localhost,
        \*.example1.com,
        .example2.com,
        example3.com,
        198.51.100.0/24,
        203.0.113.0/24,
        192.0.2.0/24
        </pre>

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: By default the 
    <code>169.254.169.254</code>, <code>10.100.0.0/8</code> and <code>10.200.0.0/8</code> 
    IP address ranges,
    <code>.internal</code>, <code>.svc</code>,<code>.svc.cluster.local</code>, <code>.svc.cluster</code>,

    Do not use the <code>_</code> character in the <strong>No Proxy</strong> field. Entering an
    underscore character in this field can cause upgrades to fail.
    <br><br>
    Because some jobs in the VMs accept `\*.` as a wildcard, while others only accept `.`, 
    we recommend that you define a wildcard domain using both of them. 
    For example, to denote `example.com` as a wildcard domain, add both `\*.example.com` and `example.com` 
    to the **No Proxy** property.
