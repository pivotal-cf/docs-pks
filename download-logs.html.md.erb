title: Downloading Logs from VMs

This topic describes how to use the BOSH Command Line Interface (CLI) to download logs from the BOSH-deployed VMs in your <%= vars.product_full %> (<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>) environment.  

<br>
<br>
## <a id="overview"></a>Overview

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> uses BOSH to deploy the VMs in <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> environments. For example, 
the <%= vars.control_plane %> VM and the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>-provisioned Kubernetes cluster VMs in your environment are BOSH-deployed VMs.  

Use the BOSH CLI to download logs from the BOSH-deployed VMs in your environment when troubleshooting or auditing <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>:

To download logs from a BOSH-deployed VM:

1. Gather credential and IP address information for your BOSH Director,
SSH into the Ops Manager VM,
and use the BOSH CLI to log in to the BOSH Director
from the Ops Manager VM. For more information,
see [Advanced Troubleshooting with the BOSH CLI](https://docs.pivotal.io/ops-manager/install/trouble-advanced.html).
1. After logging in to the BOSH Director,
list the names of your BOSH deployments by running:  

    ```
    bosh -e ENVIRONMENT deployments
    ```

    Where `ENVIRONMENT` is your BOSH environment alias.
    
1. Identify the names of the VMs that you want to retrieve logs from
by listing the VMs in your target BOSH deployment:  

    ```
    bosh -e ENVIRONMENT -d DEPLOYMENT vms
    ```

    Where:  
    
    * `ENVIRONMENT` is the BOSH environment alias.  
    * `DEPLOYMENT` is your target BOSH deployment name.
    Kubernetes cluster deployment names begin with `service-instance_` and include
    a unique identifier.  

    For example, the following command lists the VMs in a Kubernetes cluster:  
    
    ```console
    $ bosh -e tkgi -d service-instance_ae681cd1-7ff4-4661-b12c-49a5b543f16f vms
    ```
    
1. Download logs from a VM:  

    ```
    bosh -e ENVIRONMENT -d DEPLOYMENT logs VM-NAME
    ```

    For example:
	```console
    $ bosh -e tkgi \
    -d service-instance_ae681cd1-7ff4-4661-b12c-49a5b543f16f \
    logs master/000a1111-222b-3333-4cc5-de66f7a8899b
    ```
