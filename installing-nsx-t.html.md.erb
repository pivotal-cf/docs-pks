<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic describes how to install and configure Pivotal Container Service (PKS) on vSphere with NSX-T integration.

##<a id='architecture'></a> Deployment Topologies

There are three supported topologies in which to deploy NSX-T with PKS. Except where noted, the instructions in this topic describe how to set up all three options.

### <a id='topology-nat'></a> NAT Topology

The following figure shows a Network Address Translation (NAT) deployment:

![NAT Topology](images/vsphere/nsxt-topology-nat.png)

[View a larger version of this image.](https://docs-pks.cfapps.io/pks/images/vsphere/nsxt-topology-nat.png)

This topology has the following characteristics:

* PKS control plane (Ops Manager, BOSH Director, and PKS VM) components are all located on a logical switch that has undergone Network Address Translation on a T0.
* Kubernetes cluster master and worker nodes are located on a logical switch 
that has undergone Network Address Translation on a T0. This requires DNAT rules to allow access to Kubernetes APIs.

### <a id='topology-no-nat-virtual-switch'></a> NO-NAT with Virtual Switch (VSS/VDS) Topology

The following figure shows a NO-NAT with Virtual Switch (VSS/VDS) deployment:

![NO-NAT Topology with Virtual Switch](images/vsphere/nsxt-topology-no-nat-virtual-switch.png)
 
Click [here](https://docs-pks.cfapps.io/pks/images/vsphere/nsxt-topology-no-nat-virtual-switch.png) to view a larger version of this image.

This topology has the following characteristics:

* PKS control plane (Ops Manager, BOSH Director, and PKS VM) components are using corporate routable IP addresses.
* Kubernetes cluster master and worker nodes are using corporate routable IP addresses.
* The PKS control plane is deployed outside of the NSXT-T network and the Kubernetes clusters are deployed and managed within the NSX-T network. Since BOSH needs routable access to the Kubernetes Nodes to monitor and manage them, the Kubernetes Nodes need routable access.

### <a id='topology-no-nat-logical-switch'></a> NO-NAT with Logical Switch (NSX-T) Topology

The following figure shows a NO-NAT with Logical Switch (NSX-T) deployment:

![NO-NAT Topology with Logical Switch](images/vsphere/nsxt-topology-no-nat-logical-switch.png)

Click [here](https://docs-pks.cfapps.io/pks/images/vsphere/nsxt-topology-no-nat-logical-switch.png) to view a larger version of this image.

This topology has the following characteristics:

* PKS control plane (Ops Manager, BOSH Director, and PKS VM) components are using corporate routable IP addresses.
* Kubernetes cluster master and worker nodes are using corporate routable IP addresses.
* The PKS control plane is deployed inside of the NSX-T network. Both the PKS control plane components (VMs) and the Kubernetes Nodes use corporate routable IP addresses.

##<a id='before'></a>Before You Install

Follow these steps before performing the procedures in this topic:

* Review the requirements described in [vSphere Prerequisites and Resource Requirements](vsphere-requirements.html).
* Remember that the instructions in this section are cumulative. For each step, be sure to follow instructions precisely. Complete any confirmation tasks described in the VMware <a href="https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T/index.html">NSX-T documentation</a> to verify your setup before proceeding to the next step. 
* Comply with any requirements or best practices described in the VMware <a href="https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T/index.html">NSX-T documentation</a>.
* For firewall interoperability, see [Firewall Ports and Protocols Requirements for vSphere with NSX-T](ports-protocols-nsx-t.html).

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: When using NSX-T 2.1, creating namespaces with names longer than 40 characters may result in a truncated or hashed name in the NSX-T Manager UI.</p>

##<a id='plan'></a> Step 1: Plan for Network Subnets

Plan for the following network CIDRs in the IPv4 address space according to the instructions in the VMware [NSX-T documentation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T/index.html).

* **VTEP CIDR(s)**: One or more of these networks will host your GENEVE Tunnel Endpoints on your NSX Transport Nodes. Size the networks to support all of your expected Host and Edge Transport Nodes. For example, a CIDR of `192.168.1.0/24` will provide 254 usable IPs. This will be used when creating the `ip-pool-vteps` in Step 3.
* **PKS MANAGEMENT CIDR**: This small network will be used to access PKS management components such as Ops Manager and the PKS Service VM. For example, a CIDR of `10.172.1.0/28` will provide 14 usable IPs. For the [NO-NAT deployment topologies](#architecture), this will be a corporate routable subnet /28. For the [NAT deployment topology](#topology-nat), this will be a non-routable subnet /28, and DNAT needs to be configured in NSX-T to access the PKS management components.
* **PKS LB CIDR**: This network will provide your load balancing address space for each Kubernetes cluster created by PKS. The network will also provide IP addresses for Kubernetes API access and Kubernetes exposed services. For example, `10.172.2.0/24` will provide 256 usable IPs. This network will be used when creating the `ip-pool-vips` (and configured in the **Floating IP Pool ID** field on the Networking tab in the PKS Tile) described in [Create NSX Network Objects](#create-objects-network-objects), or when the services are deployed.

Refer to the instructions in the VMware [NSX-T documentation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T/index.html) to ensure that your network topology enables the following communications:

* vCenter, NSX-T components, and ESXi hosts must be able to communicate with each other.
* The Ops Manager Director VM must be able to communicate with vCenter and the NSX Manager.
* The Ops Manager Director VM must be able to communicate with all nodes in all Kubernetes clusters.
* Each Kubernetes cluster deployed by PKS will deploy a NCP pod that must be able to communicate with the NSX Manager.

In addition, you need to plan IP Blocks for pods and nodes that will be created when PKS creates the Kubernetes cluster. You will configure the Pods IP Block ID and Nodes IP Block ID in the Networking tab of the PKS tile. 

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Do not use the following for PKS Node IP block because Harbor is using them for its internal bridges. If you create Kubernetes clusters with any of these blocks, the Kubernetes worker nodes will not be able to reach Harbor for the image pull.</p>

```

```

##<a id='deploy-nsx-t'></a> Step 2: Deploy NSX-T

Deploy NSX-T according to the instructions in the VMware [NSX-T documentation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T/index.html).

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: In general, accept default settings unless instructed otherwise.</p>

1. Deploy the NSX Manager. For more information, see [NSX Manager Installation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T/2.1/com.vmware.nsxt.install.doc/GUID-A65FE3DD-C4F1-47EC-B952-DEDF1A3DD0CF.html) in the VMware NSX-T documentation.
1. Deploy NSX Controllers. For more information, see [NSX Controller Installation and Clustering](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T/2.1/com.vmware.nsxt.install.doc/GUID-447C0417-A37B-4C2E-965E-499F52587160.html) in the VMware NSX-T documentation.
1. Join the NSX Controllers to the NSX Manager. For more information, see [Join NSX Controllers with the NSX Manager](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T/2.1/com.vmware.nsxt.install.doc/GUID-05434745-7D74-4DA8-A68E-9FE17093DA7B.html) in the VMware NSX-T documentation. 
1. Initialize the Control Cluster. For more information, see [Initialize the Control Cluster to Create a Control Cluster Master](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T/2.1/com.vmware.nsxt.install.doc/GUID-273F6344-7212-4105-9FBA-A872CD75803F.html) in the VMware NSX-T documentation.
1. Add your ESXi hosts to the NSX-T Fabric. For more information, see [Add a Hypervisor Host to the NSX-T Fabric](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T/2.1/com.vmware.nsxt.install.doc/GUID-8C0EEC08-3A63-4918-A5E2-7A94AD50B0E6.html) in the VMware NSX-T documentation. Each host must have at least one **free nic/vmnic** not already used by other vSwitches on the ESXi host for use with NSX Host Transport Nodes.
1. Deploy NSX Edge VMs. We recommend at least two VMs. For more information, see [NSX Edge Installation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T/2.1/com.vmware.nsxt.install.doc/GUID-11417AA2-5EBC-49C7-8A86-EB94604261A6.html) in the VMware NSX-T documentation. Each deployed NSX Edge VM requires free resources in your vSphere Environment to provide 8 vCPU, 16 GB of RAM, and 120 GB of storage. When deploying, you must connect the vNICs of the NSX Edge VMs to an appropriate PortGroup for your environment by completing the following steps:
  1. Connect the first Edge interface to your environment's PortGroup/VLAN where your Edge Management IP can route and communicate with the NSX Manager.
  1. Connect the second Edge interface to your environment's PortGroup/VLAN where your GENEVE VTEPs can route and communicate with each other. Your **VTEP CIDR** should be routable to this PortGroup.
  1. Connect the third Edge interface to your environment's PortGroup/VLAN where your T0 uplink interface will be located.  
  1. Join the NSX Edge VMs to the NSX-T Fabric. For more information, see [Join NSX Edge with the Management Plane](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T/2.1/com.vmware.nsxt.install.doc/GUID-11BB4CF9-BC1D-4A76-A32A-AD4C98CBF25B.html) in the VMware NSX-T documentation.

##<a id='create-objects'></a> Step 3: Create the NSX-T Objects Required for PKS

Create the NSX-T objects (network objects, logical switches, NSX Edge, and logical routers) needed for PKS deployment according to the instructions in the VMware [NSX-T documentation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T/index.html). 

###<a id='create-objects-network-objects'></a> 3.1: Create NSX Network Objects

1. Create two NSX IP pools. For more information, see [Create an IP Pool for Tunnel Endpoint IP Addresses](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T/2.1/com.vmware.nsxt.install.doc/GUID-E7F7322D-D09B-481A-BD56-F1270D7C9692.html) in the VMware NSX-T documentation. Configuration details for the NSX IP pools:
  * One NSX IP pool for GENEVE Tunnel Endpoints `ip-pool-vteps,` within the usable range of the **VTEP CIDR** created in Step 1, to be used with NSX Transport Nodes that you create later in this section
  * One NSX IP pool for NSX Load Balancing VIPs `ip-pool-vips,` within the usable range of the **PKS LB CIDR** created in Step 1, to be used with the T0 Logical Router that you create later in this section
1. Create two NSX Transport Zones (TZs). For more information, see [Create Transport Zones](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T/2.1/com.vmware.nsxt.install.doc/GUID-F739DC79-4358-49F4-9C58-812475F33A66.html) in the VMware NSX-T documentation. Configuration details for the NSX TZs:
  * One NSX TZ for PKS control plane Services and Kubernetes Cluster deployment overlay networks named `tz-overlay` and the associated N-VDS `hs-overlay`. Select **Standard**.
  * One NSX TZ for NSX Edge uplinks (ingress/egress) for PKS Kubernetes clusters named `tz-vlan` and the associated N-VDS `hs-vlan`. Select **Standard**.
1. If the default uplink profile is not applicable in your deployment, create your own NSX uplink host profile. For more information, see [Create an Uplink Profile](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T/2.1/com.vmware.nsxt.install.doc/GUID-50FDFDFB-F660-4269-9503-39AE2BBA95B4.html) in the VMware NSX-T documentation.
1. Create NSX Host Transport Nodes. For more information, see [Create a Host Transport Node](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T/2.1/com.vmware.nsxt.install.doc/GUID-D7CA778B-6554-4A23-879D-4BC336E01031.html) in the VMware NSX-T documentation. Configuration details: 
  * For each host in the NSX-T Fabric, create a node named `tnode-host-NUMBER`. For example, if you have three hosts in the NSX-T Fabric, create three nodes named `tnode-host-1`, `tnode-host-2`, and `tnode-host-3`.
  * Add the `tz-overlay` NSX Transport Zone to each NSX Host Transport Node.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The Transport Nodes must be placed on free host NICs not already used by other vSwitches on the ESXi host. Use the <code>ip-pool-vteps</code> IP pool that allows them to route and communicate with each other, as well as other Edge Transport Nodes, to build GENEVE tunnels.</p>
1. We recommend that you use two separate NSX IP Blocks, one for the Node Networks and another for the Pod Networks. Create an NSX IP Block named `node-network-ip-block` and a separate one named node-network-ip-block. For more information, see [Manage IP Blocks](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T/2.1/com.vmware.nsxt.admin.doc/GUID-46C7B20D-4BE4-400E-AF39-1ADFE945DE38.html) in the VMware NSX-T documentation. PKS will use the node-network-ip-block to assign address space to Kubernetes nodes (Masters, Workers) when new clusters are deployed and/or a cluster increases its scale. The NSX-T Container Plug-in (NCP) will use the pod-network-ip-block to assign address space to Kubernetes pods through the Container Networking Interface (CNI).

###<a id='create-objects-logical-switches'></a> 3.2: Create Logical Switches

1. Create the following NSX Logical Switches. For more information, see [Create a Logical Switch](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T/2.1/com.vmware.nsxt.admin.doc/GUID-23194F9A-416A-40EA-B9F7-346B391C3EF8.html) in the VMware NSX-T documentation. Configuration details for the Logical Switches:
  * One for T0 ingress/egress uplink port `ls-pks-uplink` 
  * One for the PKS Management Network `ls-pks-mgmt`
    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: This network is required for the <a href="#topology-nat">NAT deployment topology</a> and <a href="#topology-no-nat-logical-switch">NO-NAT with Logical Switch deployment topology</a>. If you are deploying the <a href="#topology-no-nat-virtual-switch">NO-NAT with Virtual Switch topology</a>, you can skip this step.</p>
  * One for the PKS Service Network `ls-pks-service`
1. Attach your first NSX Logical Switch to the `tz-vlan` NSX Transport Zone.
1. Attach your second and third NSX Logical Switches to the `tz-overlay` NSX Transport Zone.

###<a id='create-objects-create-nsx-edge'></a> 3.3: Create NSX Edge Objects

1. Create NSX Edge Transport Nodes. For more information, see [Create an NSX Edge Transport Node](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T/2.1/com.vmware.nsxt.install.doc/GUID-53295329-F02F-44D7-A6E0-2E3A9FAE6CF9.html) in the VMware NSX-T documentation.
1. Add both `tz-vlan` and `tz-overlay` NSX Transport Zones to the NSX Edge Transport Nodes. Controller Connectivity and Manager Connectivity should be **UP**.
1. Refer to the MAC addresses of the Edge VM interfaces you deployed to deploy your virtual NSX Edges:
  1. Connect the `hs-overlay` N-VDS to the vNIC (`fp-eth#`) that matches the MAC address of the second NIC from your deployed Edge VM. 
  1. Connect the `hs-vlan` N-VDS to the vNIC (`fp-eth#`) that matches the MAC address of the third NIC from your deployed Edge VM.
1. Create an NSX Edge cluster named `edge-cluster-pks`. For more information, see [Create an NSX Edge Cluster](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T/2.1/com.vmware.nsxt.install.doc/GUID-898099FC-4ED2-4553-809D-B81B494B67E7.html) in the VMware NSX-T documentation.
1. Add the NSX Edge Transport Nodes to the cluster.

###<a id='create-objects-logical-routers'></a> 3.4: Create Logical Routers

####<a id='create-objects-logical-router-pks'></a> Create T0 Logical Router for PKS
T0 routers are edge routers that help route data between your non-NSX-T (such as a Physical Network) and the NSX-T network. PKS currently supports only a single T0 router per instance.

1. Create a Tier-0 (T0) logical router named `t0-pks`. For more information, see [Create a Tier-0 Logical Router](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T/2.1/com.vmware.nsxt.admin.doc/GUID-7891E6E7-606D-4F79-8AB7-BC01898F9FE7.html) in the VMware NSX-T documentation. Configuration details: 
  * Select `edge-cluster-pks` for the cluster.   
  * Set **High Availability Mode** to **Active-Standby**. NAT rules will be applied on T0 by NCP. If not set **Active-Standby**, the router will not support NAT rule configuration.

1. Attach the T0 logical router to the `ls-pks-uplink` logical switch you created previously. For more information, see [Connect a Tier-0 Logical Router to a VLAN Logical Switch](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T/2.1/com.vmware.nsxt.admin.doc/GUID-D641380B-4C8E-4C8A-AF64-4261A266ACA4.html) in the VMware NSX-T documentation. Create a logical router port for `ls-pks-uplink` and assign an IP address and CIDR that your environment will use to route to all PKS assigned IP pools and IP blocks.
1. Configure T0 routing to the rest of your environment using the appropriate routing protocol for your environment or by using static routes. For more information, see [Tier-0 Logical Router](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T/2.1/com.vmware.nsxt.admin.doc/GUID-3F163DEE-1EE6-4D80-BEBF-8D109FDB577C.html) in the VMware NSX-T documentation. The CIDR used in `ip-pool-vips` *must* route to the IP you just assigned to your t0 uplink interface.

####<a id='nsx-edge-ha'></a> (Optional) Configure NSX Edge for High Availability (HA)

You can configure NSX Edge for high availability (HA) using Active/Standby mode to support failover, as shown in the following figure.

![NSX Edge High Availability](images/vsphere/nsxt-edge-ha.png)

To configure NSX Edge for HA, complete the following steps: 

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: All IP addresses must belong to the same subnet.</p>

Step 1: On the T0 router, create a second uplink attached to the second Edge transport node: 

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Setting</th>
    <th>First Uplink</th>
    <th>Second Uplink</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>IP Address/Mask</td>
    <td>uplink&#95;1&#95;ip</td>
    <td>uplink&#95;2&#95;ip</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>URPF Mode</td>
    <td>None (optional)</td>
    <td>None (optional)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Transport Node</td>
    <td>edge-TN1</td>
    <td>edge-TN2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>LS</td>
    <td>uplink-LS1</td>
    <td>uplink-LS1</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Step 2: On the T0 router, create the HA VIP: 

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Setting</th>
    <th>HA VIP</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>VIP address</td>
    <td>[ha&#95;vip&#95;ip]</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Uplinks ports</td>
    <td>uplink-1 and uplink-2</td>
  </tr>
</table>

The HA VIP will become the official IP for the T0 router uplink. External router devices peering with the T0 router _must_ use this IP address.

Step 3: On the physical router, configure the next hop to point to the HA VIP address.

Step 4: You can verify your setup by running the following commands:

<pre class="terminal">
nsx-edge-n&gt; get high-availability channels
nsx-edge-n&gt; get high-availability channels stats
nsx-edge-n&gt; get logical-router
nsx-edge-n&gt; get logical-router ROUTER-UUID high-availability status
</pre>

####<a id='create-objects-logical-router-t1-pks'></a> Create T1 Logical Router for PKS Management VMs

1. Create a Tier-1 (T1) logical router for PKS management VMs named `t1-pks-mgmt`. For more information, see [Create a Tier-1 Logical Router](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T/2.1/com.vmware.nsxt.admin.doc/GUID-A6042263-374F-4292-892E-BC86876325A4.html) in the VMware NSX-T documentation. Configuration details:
  * Link to the `t0-pks` logical router you created in a previous step.
  * Select `edge-cluster-pks` for the cluster. <br/>
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Skip this step if you are deploying the NO-NAT with Virtual Switch topology. This Logical Router is required for the <a href="#topology-nat">NAT deployment topology</a> and NO-NAT with Logical Switch deployment topology. .
1. Create a logical router port for `ls-pks-mgmt` and assign the following CIDR block: `10.172.1.0/28`. For more information, see [Connect a Tier-0 Logical Router to a VLAN Logical Switch](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T/2.1/com.vmware.nsxt.admin.doc/GUID-D641380B-4C8E-4C8A-AF64-4261A266ACA4.html) in the VMware NSX-T documentation.
1. Configure route advertisement on the T1 as follows. For more information, see [Configure Route Advertisement on a Tier-1 Logical Router](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T/2.1/com.vmware.nsxt.admin.doc/GUID-B6AF9E08-1334-4D3A-B8ED-D0CAB3B563FB.html) in the VMware NSX-T documentation. Configuration details:
   * Enable **Status**.
   * Enable **Advertise All NSX Connected Routes**.
   * Enable **Advertise All NAT Routes**.
   * Enable **Advertise All LB VIP Routes**.
   
####<a id='configure-nat-logical-router-pks-mgmt'></a> Configure NAT Rules for PKS Management VMs

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: This step applies to the <a href="#topology-nat">NAT deployment topology</a> only. Skip this step for <a href="#architecture">NO-NAT deployment topologies</a>.</p>

Create the following NAT rules for the Mgmt T0. For more information, see [Tier-0 NAT](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T/2.1/com.vmware.nsxt.admin.doc/GUID-C24C751C-74CE-47BE-93B6-E5B7C646C343.html) in the VMware NSX-T documentation. Configuration details:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Type</th>
    <th>For</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>DNAT</td>
    <td>External -> Ops Manager</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>DNAT</td>
    <td>External -> Pivotal Container Service</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>SNAT</td>
    <td>Ops Manager & BOSH Director -> DNS</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>SNAT</td>
    <td>Ops Manager & BOSH Director -> NTP</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>SNAT</td>
    <td>Ops Manager & BOSH Director -> vCenter</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>SNAT</td>
    <td>Ops Manager & BOSH Director -> ESXi</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>SNAT</td>
    <td>Ops Manager & BOSH Director -> NSX-T Manager</td>
  </tr>
</table>

The Destination NAT (DNAT) rule on the T0 maps an external IP address from the **PKS MANAGEMENT CIDR** to the IP where you deploy Ops Manager on the `ls-pks-mgmt` logical switch. For example, a DNAT rule that maps `10.172.1.2` to `172.31.0.2`, where `172.31.0.2` is the IP address you assign to Ops Manager when connected to `ls-pks-mgmt`. Later, you create another DNAT rule to map an external IP address from the **PKS MANAGEMENT CIDR** to the PKS endpoint.

The Source NAT (SNAT) rule on the T0 allows the PKS Management VMs to communicate with your vCenter and NSX Manager environments. For example, an SNAT rule that maps `172.31.0.0/24` to `10.172.1.1`, where `10.172.1.1` is a routable IP address from your **PKS MANAGEMENT CIDR**. For more information, see [Configure Source NAT on a Tier-1 Router] (https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T/2.1/com.vmware.nsxt.admin.doc/GUID-31CEF010-0C34-4C10-9443-13A0EAAABFD6.html) in the VMware NSX-T documentation.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Ops Manager and BOSH must use the NFCP protocol to the actual ESX hosts to which it is uploading stemcells. Specifically, <strong>Ops Manager & BOSH Director -> ESXi</strong>.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Limit the Destination CIDR for the SNAT rules to the subnets that contain your vCenter and NSX Manager IP addresses.</p>

##<a id='deploy-ops-man'></a> Step 4: Deploy Ops Manager

Complete the procedures in [Deploying Ops Manager to vSphere](vsphere-om-deploy.html).

##<a id='config-ops-man'></a> Step 5: Configure Ops Manager

Perform the following steps to configure Ops Manager for the NSX logical switches:

1. Complete the procedures in [Configuring Ops Manager on vSphere](vsphere-om-config.html).
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you have Pivotal Application Service (PAS) installed, we recommend installing PKS on a separate instance of Ops Manager v2.0.</p>
  * On the **vCenter Config** page, select **NSX Networking - NSX-T**. This configuration is used for PAS only. You configure NSX-T integration for PKS in a later step.

###<a id='networking'></a> Networking

Perform the following steps:

1. Click **Networking**.
1. Under **Network**, select **NSX-T** as the **Container Networking Interface**.
  ![NSX-T Networking configuration pane in Ops Manager](images/networking-nsx-t.png)
1. For **NSX Manager hostname**, enter the hostname or IP address of your NSX Manager.
1. For **NSX Manager Super User Principal Identify Certificate**, copy and paste the contents and private key of the Principal Identity certificate you created in [Step 6: Generate and Register Certificates](#certificates). 
1. (Optional) For **NSX Manager CA Cert**, enter the custom CA certificate to be used to connect to the NSX Manager.
1. The **Disable SSL certificate verification** checkbox is **not** selected by default. In order to disable TLS verification, select the checkbox. You may want to disable TLS verification if you did not enter a CA certificate, or if your CA certificate is self-signed.
1. If you are using a NAT deployment topology, leave the **NAT mode** checkbox selected. If you are using a NO-NAT topology, clear this checkbox. For more information, see the [Deployment Topologies](#architecture) section above. 
1. Depending on your deployment, enter one of the following IP Block settings:
  ![NSX-T Networking configuration pane in Ops Manager](images/networking-nsx-t-2.png)
  * **Pods IP Block ID**: Enter the UUID of the IP block to be used for Kubernetes pods. PKS allocates IP addresses for the pods when they are created in Kubernetes. Each time a namespace is created in Kubernetes, a subnet from this IP block is allocated. The current subnet size that is created is /24, which means a maximum of 256 pods can be created per namespace.
  * **Nodes IP Block ID**: Enter the UUID of the IP block to be used for Kubernetes pods. PKS allocates IP addresses for the nodes when they are created in Kubernetes. The node networks will be created on a separate IP address space from the pod networks. The current subnet size that is created is /24, which means a maximum of 256 nodes can be created per cluster.
1. For **T0 Router ID**, enter the `t0-pks` T0 router UUID. Locate this value in the NSX-T UI router overview.
1. For **Floating IP Pool ID**, enter the `ip-pool-vips` ID that you created for load balancer VIPs (see <a href="#plan">Step 1: Plan for Network Subnets</a>). PKS uses the floating IP pool to allocate IP addresses to the load balancers created for each of the clusters. The load balancer routes the API requests to the master nodes and the data plane.
1. For **Nodes DNS**, enter one or more Domain Name Servers used by the Kubernetes nodes.
1. For **vSphere Cluster Names**, enter the names of the vSphere clusters you used when creating the PKS API VM in [Assign AZs and Networks](#azs-networks).
1. (Optional) To configure a global proxy for all outgoing HTTP/HTTPS traffic from your Kubernetes clusters, do the following:
  1. Under **HTTP/HTTPS proxy**, select **Enabled**.
    ![Networking pane configuration](images/networking-https-proxy.png)
  1. Under **HTTP Proxy URL**, enter the URL of your HTTP/HTTPS proxy endpoint. For example, `http://myproxy.com:1234`.
  1. (Optional) If your proxy uses basic authentication, enter the username and password in either **HTTP Proxy Credentials** or **HTTPS Proxy Credentials**.
  1. Under **No Proxy**, enter the service network CIDR where your PKS cluster is deployed. List any additional IP addresses that should bypass the proxy.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: By default, the <code>.internal</code>, <code>10.100.0.0/8</code>, and <code>10.200.0.0/8</code> IP address ranges are not proxied. This allows internal PKS communication.</p>
1. Click **Save**.

##<a id='apply-changes'></a> Step 8: Apply Changes and Retrieve the PKS Endpoint

1. After configuring the tile, return to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Apply Changes** to deploy the PKS tile.
1. When the installation is completed, retrieve the PKS endpoint by performing the following steps:
  1. From the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard, click the **Pivotal Container Service** tile.
  1. Click the **Status** tab and record the IP address assigned to the `Pivotal Container Service` job.
1. Create a DNAT rule on the `t1-pks-mgmt` T1 to map an external IP from the **PKS MANAGEMENT CIDR** to the PKS endpoint. For example, a DNAT rule that maps `10.172.1.4` to `172.31.0.4`, where `172.31.0.4` is PKS endpoint IP address on the `ls-pks-mgmt` NSX Logical Switch.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Ensure that you have no overlapping NAT rules. If your NAT rules overlap, you cannot reach Ops Manager from VMs in the vCenter network.</p>

Developers should use the DNAT IP address when logging in with the PKS CLI. For more information, see [Using PKS](using.html).
