<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic describes how to deploy and access basic workloads in Pivotal Container Service (PKS).

If you use Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Amazon Web Services (AWS), or vSphere with NSX-T integration, your cloud provider can configure a load balancer for your workload.
If you use AWS, see the [AWS Prerequisites](#aws) section before you create the load balancer.

If you use vSphere without NSX-T, you can choose to configure your own external load balancer or expose static ports to access your workload without a load balancer.

* [Access Workloads Using an External Load Balancer](#external-lb)

* [Access Workloads without a Load Balancer](#without-lb)

## <a id='aws'></a>AWS Prerequisites

If you use AWS, perform the following steps before you create a load balancer:

1. In the [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/), create or locate a public subnet for each availability zone (AZ) you are deploying to. A public subnet has a route table that directs Internet-bound traffic to the Internet gateway.

1. On the command line, run `pks cluster CLUSTER-NAME`, replacing `CLUSTER-NAME` with the name of your cluster.

1. Record the unique identifier for the cluster.

1. In the [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/), tag each public subnet with `kubernetes.io/cluster/service-instance_CLUSTER-UUID`, replacing `CLUSTER-UUID` with the unique identifier of the cluster.
  <p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: AWS limits the number of tags on a subnet to 50.</p>

## <a id='with-lb'></a>Access Workloads Using an Internal Load Balancer

If you use GCP, AWS, or vSphere with NSX-T, follow the steps below to deploy and access basic workloads using a load balancer configured by your cloud provider.

<p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: This approach creates a dedicated load balancer for each workload. This may be an inefficient use of resources in clusters with many apps.</p>

1. Expose the workload using a Service with `type: LoadBalancer`. See the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#type-loadbalancer) for more information about the `LoadBalancer` Service type.

1. Download the spec for a basic NGINX app from the [cloudfoundry-incubator/kubo-ci](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/kubo-ci/blob/master/specs/nginx-lb.yml) GitHub repository.

1. Run `kubectl create -f nginx.yml` to deploy the basic NGINX app. This command creates three pods (replicas) that span three worker nodes.

1. Wait until your cloud provider creates a dedicated load balancer and connects it to the worker nodes on a specific port.

1. Run `kubectl get svc nginx` and retrieve the load balancer IP address and port number.

1. On the command line of a server with network connectivity and visibility to the IP address of the worker node, run `curl http://EXTERNAL-IP:PORT` to access the app. Replace `EXTERNAL-IP` with the IP address of the load balancer and `PORT` with the port number.

## <a id='external-lb'></a>Access Workloads Using an External Load Balancer

All deployments can use an external load balancer.
To use an external load balancer, follow the steps below to deploy and access basic workloads.

1. Expose every workload and app using a Service with `type: NodePort`. See the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#type-nodeport) for more information about the `NodePort` Service type.

1. Map each node port exposed in the worker nodes that you need to an external port in your external load balancer. The process to map these ports depends on your load balancer. See your external load balancer documentation for more information.

1. For each app, run `curl http://LOAD-BALANCER-IP:EXTERNAL-PORT`. Replace `LOAD-BALANCER-IP` with the IP address of your external load balancer and `EXTERNAL-PORT` with the external port number.

## <a id='without-lb'></a>Access Workloads without a Load Balancer

If you use vSphere without NSX-T integration, you do not have a load balancer configured by your cloud provider.
You can choose to [configure your own external load balancer](#external-lb) or follow the procedures in this section to access your workloads without a load balancer.

If you do not use an external load balancer, you can configure the NGINX service to expose a static port on each worker node.
From outside the cluster, you can reach the service at `http://NODE-IP:NODE-PORT`.

To expose a static port on your workload, perform the following steps:

1. Download the spec for a basic NGINX app from the [cloudfoundry-incubator/kubo-ci](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/kubo-ci/blob/master/specs/nginx.yml) GitHub repository.

1. Run `kubectl create -f nginx.yml` to deploy the basic NGINX app. This command creates three pods (replicas) that span three worker nodes.

1. Expose the workload using a Service with `type: NodePort`. See the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#type-nodeport) for more information about the `NodePort` Service type.

1. Retrieve the IP address for a worker node with a running NGINX pod.
  <p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: If you deployed more than four worker
  nodes, some worker nodes may not contain a running NGINX pod. Select a worker
  node that contains a running NGINX pod.</p>

    You can retrieve the IP address for a worker node with a running NGINX pod in
    one of the following ways:
    * On the command line, run `kubectl get nodes`. Select a node name, then locate the node name in the vCenter or GCP Console to find the IP address.
    * On the Ops Manager command line, run `bosh vms` to find the IP address.

1. On the command line, run `kubectl get svc nginx`. Find the node port number in the `3XXXX` range.

1. On the command line of a server with network connectivity and visibility to the IP address of the worker node, run `curl http://NODE-IP:NODE-PORT` to access the app. Replace `NODE-IP` with the IP address of the worker node, and `NODE-PORT` with the node port number.
