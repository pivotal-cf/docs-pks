title: Delete Your Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition Deployment
owner: TKGI

If you no longer require an <%= vars.product_short %> deployment on vSphere, you can use VMware <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console to delete it. The deletion process removes all objects from the vSphere inventory, and cleans up the objects in the <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console VM related to your deployment.

If <%= vars.product_short %> fails to deploy correctly, always use <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console to cleanly remove the failed deployment. 

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: You must use the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> CLI to delete any existing clusters and nodes before you can use the management console to delete your <%= vars.product_short %> deployment.</p>

1. Go to the **TKG Integrated Edition** view of the management console.
1. Click the **Action** drop-down menu and select **Delete Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition Deployment**
1. Click **Delete** to confirm the deletion of the deployment.
