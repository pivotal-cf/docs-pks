This topic describes how the Pivotal Container Service (PKS) API works with User Account and Authentication (UAA) to manage authentication and authorization in your PKS deployment.

##<a id='authenticating'></a> Authenticating PKS API Requests

Before users can log in and use the PKS CLI, you must [configure PKS API access](configure-api.html) with UAA.
You use the UAA Command Line Interface (UAAC) to target the UAA server and request an access token for the UAA admin user.
If your request is successful, the UAA server returns the access token.
The UAA admin access token authorizes you to make requests to the PKS API using the PKS CLI and [grant cluster access](manage-users.html#cluster-access) to new or existing users.

When a user with cluster access logs in to the PKS CLI, the CLI requests an access token for the user from the UAA server.
If the request is successful, the UAA server returns an access token to the PKS CLI.
When the user runs PKS CLI commands, for example, `pks clusters`, the CLI sends the request to the PKS API server and includes the user's UAA token.

The PKS API sends a request to the UAA server to validate the user's token.
If the UAA server confirms that the token is valid, the PKS API uses the cluster information from the PKS broker to respond to the request.
For example, if the user runs `pks clusters`, the CLI returns a list of the clusters that the user is authorized to manage.

##<a id='routing'></a>Routing to the PKS API Control Plane VM

The PKS API server and the UAA server use different port numbers on the control plane VM.
For example, if your PKS API domain is `api.pks.example.com`, you can reach your PKS API and UAA servers at the following URLs:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Server</th>
    <th>URL</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>PKS API</td>
    <td>api.pks.example.com:9021</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>UAA</td>
    <td>api.pks.example.com:8443</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Refer to **Ops Manager > Pivotal Container Service > PKS API > API Hostname (FQDN)** for your PKS API domain.

Load balancer implementations differ by deployment environment. For PKS deployments on GCP or on vSphere _without_ NSX-T, 
when you install the PKS tile, you configure a load balancer for the PKS API. This load balancer allows you 
to run PKS CLI commands from your local workstation. For more information, see the _Configure External Load Balancer_ section of Installing and Configuring PKS. For procedures about routing to the PKS control plane VM, see [Installing and Configuring PKS ](installing-pks.html#loadbalancer-pks-api).
For procedures that describe routing to the PKS control plane VM, see [Configure Routing to the PKS API](configure-api.html#routing) section of _Configure PKS API Access_. For overview information, see [Load Balancers in PKS Deployments without NSX-T](about-lb.html#without-nsx-t).
