To upgrade a TKGI installation that runs on multiple datacenters, include the following steps:

1. Upload to Ops Manager a TKGI tile version that supports multiple datacenters.
    * Support for multiple datacenters varies between TKGI patch releases within the same minor release line, with later patch releases supporting the functionality while earlier ones do not.
1. In the TKGI tile > **Kubernetes Cloud Profile** pane, set **vSphere Datacenter** to a comma-separated list of datacenters, for example `"DC1, DC2, folder-name/DC3"`. For datacenters that are under folders in your inventory, include the folder in the name.
<% if current_page.data.windowsclusters != true && current_page.data.iaas != "vSphere" &&  current_page.data.iaas != "vSphere-NSX-T" %>
1. If you are using NSX networking, update the TKGI tile > **Networking** pane > **vSphere Cluster** list to include the clusters' datacenters in their names, for example, `"DC1:cluster1, DC2:cluster2, DC-folder-name/DC3:cluster3"`.
<% end %>

    After upgrading TKGI with multiple datacenters, you can use the `tkgi` CLI to upgrade TKGI clusters.

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The TKGI Management Console does not yet support upgrading TKGI running on multiple datacenters.
