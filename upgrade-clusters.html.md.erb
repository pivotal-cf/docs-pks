This topic describes how to use the <%= vars.product_full %> Command Line Interface (<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> CLI) 
to upgrade <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>-provisioned Kubernetes clusters.  

For information about how to upgrade <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>-provisioned clusters
through the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile, 
see _Verify Errand Configuration_ in one of the following topics:

* [Upgrading <%= vars.product_short %> (Antrea and Flannel Networking)](upgrade.html)
* [Upgrading <%= vars.product_short %> (NSX-T Networking)](upgrade-nsxt.html)

For conceptual information about <%= vars.product_short %> upgrades,
see [About <%= vars.product_short %> Upgrades](understanding-upgrades.html).

<br>
## <a id="overview"></a>Overview

Upgrading a <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>-provisioned Kubernetes cluster updates
the <%= vars.product_short %> version and the Kubernetes version
of the cluster.  

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>-provisioned Kubernetes clusters upgrade when:

* You upgrade <%= vars.product_short %>
with the **Upgrade all clusters errand** enabled in the **<%= vars.product_tile %>** tile > **Errands**.
* You run `tkgi upgrade-cluster` or `tkgi upgrade-clusters`
as described in [Upgrade Clusters](#upgrade-clusters) below.

For example, running `tkgi upgrade-cluster`
upgrades the cluster you specify to your current version of <%= vars.product_short %>
and to the version of Kubernetes
that is included with your current version of <%= vars.product_short %>.

<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING</strong>: Do not change the number of control plane/etcd nodes 
for any plan that was used to create currently-running clusters. 
<%= vars.product_short %> does not support changing the number of control plane/etcd nodes for plans 
with existing clusters.
</p>

<br>
<br>
## <a id='prerequisites'></a>Prerequisites

Before upgrading <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>-provisioned Kubernetes clusters:  

1. If you have not already done so, install the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> CLI for the 
current <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> version. For information, 
see [Installing the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> CLI](installing-cli.html).  
1. Verify the cluster you are upgrading supports upgrading. 
For information, see [Verify Your Clusters Support Upgrading](checklist.html#resource-usage)
 in the _Upgrade Preparation Checklist for <%= vars.product_short %>_.  
1. Verify that your Kubernetes environment is healthy. 
For information, see [Verifying Deployment Health](verify-health.html).  
<% if vars.product_version == "v1.14" %>
1. [Switch to the Auto-Deployed vSphere CSI Driver Before Upgrading](#upgrade-csi-driver).  
<% end %>
1. If you are upgrading a cluster that uses a public cloud CSI driver, 
see [Limitations on Using a Public Cloud CSI Driver](release-notes.html#1-15-0-csi-driver-limits) 
in _Release Notes_ for additional requirements.  
1. Log in to <%= vars.product_short %> using `tkgi login`.
For more information, see [Logging in to <%= vars.product_short %>](login.html).  

<% if vars.product_version == "v1.14" %>
<br>
###<a id='upgrade-csi-driver'></a>Switch to the Auto-Deployed vSphere CSI Driver Before Upgrading

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.14 and later do not support the manually installed vSphere CSI driver.  

If you have manually installed the vSphere CSI driver on your clusters, 
you must switch your clusters to use the automatically installed CSI driver before upgrading the clusters to <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.14.  

For more information, 
see [Switch From the Manually Installed vSphere CSI Driver to the Automatic CSI Driver](vsphere-cns.html#uninstall-csi) 
in _Deploying and Managing Cloud Native Storage (CNS) on vSphere_.

## <a id='upgrade-clusters'></a>Upgrade Clusters

You can upgrade a cluster's <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> version to the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> version currently running on the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> control plane.  

To upgrade a cluster's <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> version:  

1. [Customize Cluster Container Runtimes Before Upgrading](#upgrade-runtime)  

1. Use the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> CLI to upgrade the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> version on individual or multiple clusters:  

    * [Upgrade a Single Kubernetes Cluster](#upgrade-cluster)  
    * [Upgrade Multiple Kubernetes Clusters](#upgrade-clusters-multi)  

1. To monitor or stop a cluster upgrade, follow the procedures in 
[Manage Your Kubernetes Cluster Upgrade Job](#manage-upgrade) below.  

1. Complete the steps in [After Upgrading Clusters](#after-upgrade-clusters) below.  


<% if vars.product_version == "v1.14" %>
<br>
### <a id='upgrade-runtime'></a>(Optional) Customize Cluster Container Runtimes Before Upgrading

By default, the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.14 `upgrade-cluster` errand will switch a cluster's container runtime from Docker to containerd.  

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning</strong>:  During a <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> upgrade, cluster workloads will experience downtime while the cluster switches 
    from using the Docker container runtime to containerd. 
    To avoid workload downtime, <%= vars.recommended_by %> recommends that you switch your clusters to the containerd container runtime before upgrading to <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> <%= vars.product_version %>. 
    For more information, see <a href="release-notes.html#1-14-0-coredns-downtime">Cluster Workloads Experience Downtime While Upgrading and Switching Container Runtimes</a> in the <i>Release Notes</i> 
    or <a href="checklist.html#upgrade-runtime">Customize Cluster Container Runtimes Before Upgrading</a> in <i>Upgrade Preparation Checklist for TKGI</i>.
</p>


<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning</strong>: The default value for <code>lock_container_runtime</code> is <code>false</code>. 
The upgrade to <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.14.0 will switch a "locked" cluster to using the containerd runtime
if, between locking and upgrading, you run <code>tkgi update-cluster</code> without including the <code>lock_container_runtime: true</code> parameter in your configuration.
</p>  

All Docker container runtime clusters must be switched to use the containerd-runtime prior to upgrading to <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.15.

<% end %>


<br>
### <a id='upgrade-cluster'></a>Upgrade a Single Cluster

The <%= vars.product_short %> CLI provides `upgrade-cluster` for upgrading an individual <%= vars.product_tile %>-provisioned 
Kubernetes cluster. 

To upgrade an individual Kubernetes cluster:  

1. Run the following command:

    ```
    tkgi upgrade-cluster CLUSTER-NAME
    ```
    Where `CLUSTER-NAME` is the name of the Kubernetes cluster you want to upgrade.  

For more information about the `tkgi upgrade-cluster` command, 
see [tkgi upgrade-cluster](cli/index.html#upgrade-cluster) in the _<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> CLI_ documentation.  

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong>
The nodes in an upgrading cluster are processed serially.  
</p>

To upgrade multiple clusters, see [Upgrade Multiple Kubernetes Clusters](#upgrade-clusters-multi) below.  

<br>
### <a id='upgrade-clusters-multi'></a>Upgrade Multiple Clusters

The <%= vars.product_short %> CLI provides `upgrade-clusters` for upgrading multiple <%= vars.product_tile %>-provisioned 
Kubernetes clusters. 
You can upgrade clusters serially, serially with some clusters designated as canary clusters, or entirely in parallel.  

To upgrade multiple Kubernetes clusters:  

1. Run the following command:  

    ```
    tkgi upgrade-clusters CLUSTER-NAMES
    ```
    Where `CLUSTER-NAMES` is a list of names of the Kubernetes clusters that you want to upgrade.

For more information about the `tkgi upgrade-clusters` command, 
see [tkgi upgrade-clusters](cli/index.html#upgrade-clusters) in the _<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> CLI_ documentation.  

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong>
The nodes in an upgrading cluster are always processed serially.  
</p>

To upgrade a single cluster, see [Upgrade a Single Kubernetes Cluster](#upgrade-cluster) above.  

For more information about the `tkgi upgrade-clusters` command, see [tkgi upgrade-clusters](cli/index.html#upgrade-clusters) in the _<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> CLI_ documentation.    


<br>
#### <a id='upgrade-clusters-parallel'></a> Upgrade Clusters in Parallel

To upgrade multiple Kubernetes clusters:  

1. Run the following command:  

    ```
    tkgi upgrade-clusters --clusters CLUSTER-NAMES --max-in-flight CLUSTER-COUNT --wait
    ```
    Where:

    * `CLUSTER-NAMES` is a comma-delimited list of the names of the Kubernetes clusters you want to upgrade. 

    * `CLUSTER-COUNT` is the maximum number of clusters to upgrade in parallel within an AZ. 
        The `CLUSTER-COUNT` must be less than your TKGI tile > TKGI API Service > <strong>Worker VM Max in Flight</strong> value. 
        For example, if your TKGI tile <strong>Worker VM Max in Flight</strong> value remains the default of <code>4</code>, 
        run <code>upgrade-clusters</code> with a <code>--max-in-flight</code> argument value less than <code>4</code>.  
      
Considerations when running `tkgi upgrade-clusters`:  

* If an upgrade for a cluster in the `--clusters` list fails, the `tkgi upgrade-clusters` job continues to a subsequent cluster in the list.  
* Clusters are upgraded serially if `--max-in-flight` is not set.  
* If the count of names in the `--clusters` list is more than the `--max-in-flight` value, 
    the first set of clusters are upgraded in parallel and subsequent clusters are queued. 
    As the initial cluster upgrades complete, the remaining clusters are pulled from the queue and upgraded in parallel.  
* To run the cluster upgrade job as a background task, remove the `--wait` argument.  

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong>
The nodes in an upgrading cluster are always processed serially.  
</p>

For example:

```
$ tkgi upgrade-clusters --clusters k8-cluster-000,k8-cluster-001,k8-cluster-002 --max-in-flight 2  --wait  
  
You are about to upgrade k8-cluster-000, k8-cluster-001 and k8-cluster-002.  
Warning: This operation might be long running and might block further operations on the cluster(s) until complete  
  
Continue? (y/n):y  
Your taskID for the upgrade task is: d772aba0-2670-4fba-b26c-044b19d6ab60  
Started upgrading cluster: k8-cluster-000  
Started upgrading cluster: k8-cluster-001  
Finished upgrading cluster: k8-cluster-000  
Started upgrading cluster: k8-cluster-002  
Finished upgrading cluster: k8-cluster-001  
Finished upgrading cluster: k8-cluster-002  
Upgrade task d772aba0-2670-4fba-b26c-044b19d6ab60 is done.  
```

<br>
#### <a id='upgrade-clusters-errors'></a> Upgrade Clusters With Canaries

To upgrade multiple clusters and automatically stop upgrading clusters if a cluster upgrade fails, 
specify your cluster list as canary clusters. 
You can specify one or more clusters as canary clusters.  

To upgrade multiple clusters with one or more canary clusters:  

1. Run the following command:  

    ```
    tkgi upgrade-clusters --canaries CANARY-CLUSTER-NAMES --clusters CLUSTER-NAMES --wait
    ```
    Where:

    * `CANARY-CLUSTER-NAMES` is a comma-delimited list of the names of the Kubernetes clusters you want to upgrade as canary clusters. 

    * `CLUSTER-NAMES` is a comma-delimited list of Kubernetes clusters to upgrade if all canary clusters successfully upgrade.  
    
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> 
    The <code>--clusters</code> argument is required. 
    </p>

Considerations when running `tkgi upgrade-clusters` with a `--canaries` list:  

* The clusters specified in the `--canaries` list are upgraded prior to upgrading the clusters in your `--clusters` list.  
* If a canary cluster upgrade fails, the entire `tkgi upgrade-clusters` job stops.  
* If a `--clusters` list cluster upgrade fails, the `tkgi upgrade-clusters` job continues to a subsequent cluster in the list.  
* To configure <code>tkgi upgrade-clusters</code> to stop for any cluster upgrade failure, 
    specify only one cluster in your <code>--clusters</code> list and 
    the remaining clusters in your <code>--canaries</code> list.  
* Canary clusters are always upgraded serially. 
    To upgrade clusters in the `--clusters` list in parallel, see [Upgrade Clusters in Parallel](#upgrade-clusters-parallel) above.  
* To run the cluster upgrade job as a background task, remove the `--wait` argument.  


<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong>
The nodes in an upgrading cluster are always processed serially.  
</p>


For example:

```console
$ tkgi upgrade-clusters --canaries k8-cluster-dev,k8-cluster-000,k8-cluster-001  --clusters k8-cluster-002  --wait  
  
You are about to upgrade k8-cluster-dev k8-cluster-000, k8-cluster-001 and k8-cluster-002.  
Warning: This operation might be long running and might block further operations on the cluster(s) until complete  
  
Continue? (y/n):y  
Your taskID for the upgrade task is: ce31a1bb-380a-453f-afa0-835ffa1ce6ac  
Started upgrading cluster: k8-cluster-000  
Upgrading cluster succeeded: k8-cluster-000  
Started upgrading cluster: k8-cluster-001  
Upgrading cluster succeeded: k8-cluster-001  
Started upgrading cluster: k8-cluster-dev  
Upgrading cluster failed: k8-cluster-dev  
Upgrade task ce31a1bb-380a-453f-afa0-835ffa1ce6ac is done.  
```

```

<br>
### <a id='stop-upgrade-job'></a> Stop Your Cluster Upgrade Job

To cancel a running `upgrade-clusters` job, run the following <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> CLI command:

```
tkgi cancel-task TASKID
```
Where `TASKID` is the ID of the task that was returned when you ran `tkgi upgrade-clusters`.

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> <code>tkgi cancel-task</code> does not cancel cluster upgrades currently in progress. This command only cancels a job's pending cluster upgrades.
</p>


<br>
<br>
## <a id='after-upgrade-clusters'></a>After Upgrading Clusters

Complete the following optional procedures after you have upgraded your cluster:  

* [Upgrade Velero](#upgrade-velero)
* [Restore Cluster Sizing](#restore-cluster-sizing)

<br>
### <a id='upgrade-velero'></a>Upgrade Velero

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.14 uses Velero v1.8.1. You must upgrade Velero to v1.8.1 on all of your existing clusters.

To upgrade Velero:  

1. Download [Velero v1.8.1](https://customerconnect.vmware.com/downloads/get-download?downloadGroup=VELERO-181) from VMware Customer Connect.  
1. Complete the steps in [Upgrading to Velero 1.8](https://velero.io/docs/v1.8/upgrade-to-1.8/) in the Velero documentation.  

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> Ensure you have updated the Velero custom resource definitions on your clusters 
  as described in <a href="https://velero.io/docs/v1.8/upgrade-to-1.8/#instructions">Instructions</a> 
  in <i>Upgrading to Velero 1.8</i> in the Velero documentation.
</p>

<br>
### <a id='restore-cluster-sizing'></a>(Optional) Restore Cluster Sizing
 
If you scaled your cluster up for the upgrade and you prefer to restore your cluster to its original sizing, 
you can now scale the cluster back down to its previous configuration. 
<%= vars.recommended_by %> recommends that you not scale down your clusters and continue to run them with 
recommended configurations, reducing the chance of a future outage.
