After deployment, you can reconfigure your your <%= vars.product_short %> installation in VMware <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console, either by using the wizard or by importing an updated YAML file.

## <a id='reconfigure-wizard'></a>Reconfigure Your <%= vars.product_short %> Deployment in the Wizard

The procedure to reconfigure <%= vars.product_short %> deployments in the wizard is as follows. 

1. Expand **Configuration** and go to the **<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Configuration** view of the management console.
1. Select **Wizard** to be taken to the configuration wizard for <%= vars.product_short %>.

1. Expand the different sections of the wizard and change the configurations as necessary.
<br><br>
For information about which configuration options you can change, see [Which Options Can I Reconfigure?](#reconfigure-options) below.
<br><br>
For the options that you can modify, refer to [Deploy Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition by Using the Configuration Wizard](console-deploy-wizard.html) for instructions about how to fill in each section.
1. When you have finished reconfiguring, click **Generate Configuration**.
1. Optionally export the `PksConfiguration.yaml` file to save a copy of your configuration.
1. Click **Apply Configuration** and **Continue** to complete the reconfiguration of <%= vars.product_short %>.

## <a id='reconfigure-yaml'></a>Reconfigure Your <%= vars.product_short %> Deployment by Importing a YAML File

The procedure to reconfigure <%= vars.product_short %> deployments by importing an updated YAML file is as follows. 

1. Expand **Configuration** and go to the **<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Configuration** view of the management console.
1. Select **Wizard** to be taken to the configuration wizard for <%= vars.product_short %>. 
1. Scroll to the bottom of the screen and click **Import YAML**.

    ![Reconfigure your <%= vars.product_short %> deployment](images/console/reconfigure-deployment-yaml.png)
1. Drag the YAML file into the Import Configuration File window, or click **Browse** to navigate to it.
1. In the Configuration File editor, modify the contents of the YAML file appropriately for the new instance of <%= vars.product_short %> that you want to deploy.
<br><br>
For information about which configuration options you can change, see [Which Options Can I Reconfigure?](#reconfigure-options) below.
<br><br>
If the YAML was generated by an instance of the management console that is running in a different vSphere environment, update the passwords for NSX Manager, vCenter Server, and Harbor. For more information see [Deploy Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition by Importing a YAML Configuration File](console-deploy-yaml.html).
<br><br>
To abandon this YAML and start again, click **Import** to upload the YAML again or to import a new one.
<br><br>
You can also click the **Edit in Wizard** button, to open the imported configuration in the wizard.
1. Click **Apply Configuration** and **Continue** to complete the reconfiguration of <%= vars.product_short %>.


## <a id='reconfigure-options'></a>Which Options Can I Reconfigure?

After the initial deployment of <%= vars.product_short %>, there are certain options that you cannot reconfigure. In particular, you cannot make significant infrastructure changes. 

The table below lists what you can and cannot modify on an existing <%= vars.product_short %> deployment.
