This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.14.4](#1-14-4-bug-fixes).  

Pods on updated worker nodes do not automatically restart after switching a cluster's container runtime from Docker to containerd.

**Explanation**

The Docker image is not available to containerd after successfully switching a cluster's container runtime to containerd. 
Pods on the cluster crash before a new YAML configuration for containerd can be applied.

###<a id="1-14-2-known-issues"></a>Known Issues

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.14.2 has the following known issues:

Except where noted, the known issues in <%= vars.product_short %> v1.14.1 are also in <%= vars.product_short %> v1.14.2. 
See the TKGI v1.14.1 [Known Issues](#1-14-1-known-issues) below.  

<hr>

#### <a id="1-14-2-windows-cluster-ncp-issue-2"></a> Some Windows Pods Become Unreachable

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.14.3](#1-14-3-bug-fixes).  

On occasion, the IP Addresses for one or more running Pods in a Windows cluster become unreachable. 
Pinging from within an unreachable Pod also fails, returning `Request timed out.`.

The unreachable Pods might also enter a `CrashLoopBackOff` state.

**Explanation**

CNI requests within the Pod have entered a race condition. Afterward, networking for the Pod is unreachable.

<hr>

#### <a id="1-14-2-upgrade-windows-failure"></a> Windows Worker Nodes Are Unresponsive after Update-Cluster and Upgrade-Cluster

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.14.3](#1-14-3-bug-fixes).

While updating or upgrading a Windows Worker cluster that uses the containerd container runtime, some of the cluster's nodes can become unresponsive. 
During the cluster update or upgrade, the node drain step for the cluster's nodes can time out and not finish.  

**Symptom**

While updating or upgrading a Windows Worker cluster, the drain step for some nodes hangs for an extended period, and the nodes enter an `unresponsive agent` state. 
The update or upgrade process eventually logs the error `Error: Timed out sending 'get_task' to instance` for the `executing drain` step.

#### <a id="1-14-1-windows-cluster-upgrade"></a> Upgrade of Windows cluster that has containerd as the container runtime can fail

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.14.2](#1-14-2-bug-fixes).

**Symptom**

Cluster upgrade for a Windows cluster can fail:

* If the Windows cluster has containerd as the container runtime.
* When you attempt to switch the container runtime from containerd to Docker during the cluster upgrade.

**Explanation**

The Windows cluster upgrade can fail with the following error message:

```
Error: Action Failed get_task: Task 472b18b9-484f-4323-77ed-fcabf7f51eae result: Applying: Keeping only needed packages: Uninstalling package bundle: remove /var/vcap/data/packages/containerd-windows/9beecbdcbcbc016def57e61f4914847998868a0d\containerd\containerd-shim-runhcs-v1.exe: Access is denied.
```

**Workaround**

Manually remove the VMs that have the issue. BOSH recreates the removed VMs automatically after a few minutes.

#### <a id="1-14-1-webhook-missing"></a> The vsphere-csi-webhook Is Missing after Upgrading a Cluster

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.14.2](#1-14-2-bug-fixes).  

If you have a <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> cluster that uses the vSphere CSI Drive in an air-gapped environment, 
the vsphere-csi-webhook will be missing after upgrading the cluster to <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.14.  

**Symptom**  

After upgrading a <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> cluster to <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.14, 
the Pods prefixed with `vsphere-csi-webhook-` have the status `ErrImageNeverPull`.

### <a id='1-14-0-upgrade'></a>Upgrade Path

The supported upgrade paths to <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.14.0 are from <%= vars.product_short %> v1.13.2, v1.13.1, and v1.13.0.

### <a id="1-14-0-breaking-changes"></a>Breaking Changes

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.14.0 has the following breaking changes:

* Linux and Windows cluster container runtimes are automatically switched from Docker to containerd during the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.14.0 upgrade.
    <p class="note warning"><strong>Warning</strong>:  During a <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> upgrade, cluster workloads will experience downtime while the cluster switches 
        from using the Docker container runtime to containerd.
        To avoid workload downtime, <%= vars.recommended_by %> recommends that you switch your clusters to the containerd container runtime before upgrading to <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> <%= vars.product_version %>. 
        For more information, see <a href="#1-14-0-coredns-downtime">Cluster Workloads Experience Downtime While Upgrading and Switching Container Runtimes</a> below.
    </p>
    <p class="note warning"><strong>Warning</strong>: The upgrade to <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.14.0 will switch a "locked" cluster to using the containerd runtime
    if, between locking the container runtime and upgrading, you ran <code>tkgi update-cluster</code> without including the <code>lock_container_runtime: true</code> parameter in your configuration.
    For more information on locking the container runtime, see
    <a href="checklist.html#upgrade-runtime">Customize Cluster Container Runtimes Before Upgrading</a>
    in <i>Upgrade Preparation Checklist for <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %></i>.
    </p>
* Docker commands on worker VMs' no longer work:
    Clusters using the Docker container runtime no longer default to supporting Docker command line commands.
    For more information, see [Docker Commands No Longer Work on Worker VMs](#1-14-0-docker-commands-disabled) below.
* Kubernetes has been upgraded to Kubernetes v1.23.4:
    * The CSI Migration feature is enabled by default in Kubernetes v1.23 but is not enabled by default in <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> 1.14.
    This allows administrators to control the timing of their migration from an existing in-tree storage driver.
    The CSI Migration feature remains in Beta for Google Compute Engine (GCE) PD, Amazon Web Services (AWS) EBS, and Azure Disk.

#### <a id="1-14-0-security-group"></a>Azure Default Security Group Is Not Automatically Assigned to Cluster VMs

**Symptom**

You experience issues when configuring a load balancer for a multi-control plane node Kubernetes cluster or creating a service of type `LoadBalancer`.
Additionally, in the Azure portal, the **VM** > **Networking** page does not display
any inbound and outbound traffic rules for your cluster VMs.

**Explanation**

As part of configuring the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile for Azure, you enter **Default Security Group** in the **Kubernetes Cloud Provider** pane.
When you create a Kubernetes cluster, <%= vars.product_short %> automatically assigns this security group to each VM in the cluster.
However, on Azure the automatic assignment may not occur.

As a result, your inbound and outbound traffic rules defined in the security group are not applied to the cluster VMs.

**Workaround**

If you experience this issue, manually assign the default security group to each VM NIC in your cluster.

#### <a id="1-14-0-uuid-length"></a> One Plan ID Longer than Other Plan IDs

**Symptom**

One of your plan IDs is one character longer than your other plan IDs.

**Explanation**

In <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>, each plan has a unique plan ID.
A plan ID is normally a UUID consisting of 32 alphanumeric characters and 4 hyphens.
However, the **Plan 4** ID consists of 33 alphanumeric characters and 4 hyphens.

**Solution**

You can safely configure and use **Plan 4**.
The length of the **Plan 4** ID does not affect the functionality of **Plan 4** clusters.

If you require all plan IDs to have identical length, do not activate or use **Plan 4**.

#### <a id="1-14-0-db-down-after-vm-stopped"></a> Database Cluster Stops After a Database Instance is Stopped

**Symptom**

After you stop one instance in a multiple-instance database cluster, the cluster stops,
or communication between the remaining databases times out, and the entire cluster becomes unreachable.

The following might be in your UAA log:

```
WSREP has not yet prepared node for application use
```

**Explanation**

The database cluster is unable to recover automatically because a member is no longer available to reconcile quorum.

#### <a id="1-14-0-errors-after-reinstall"></a> BOSH Director Logs the Error 'Duplicate vm extension name'

**Symptom**

After you uninstall <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>, then reinstall <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> in the same environment,
BOSH Director logs errors similar to the following:

```
.../gems/bosh-director-0.0.0/lib/bosh/director/deployment_plan/cloud_manifest_parser.rb:120:in `parse_vm_extensions': Duplicate vm extension name 'disk_enable_uuid' (Bosh::Director::DeploymentDuplicateVmExtensionName)
```

**Explanation**

The `pivotal-container-service` cloud-config was not removed when you uninstalled the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> tile,
and it remained active.
When you reinstalled the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> tile, an additional `pivotal-container-service` cloud-config was created,
causing the metrics_server to fall into a crash-loop state.

**Workaround**

You must manually remove the `pivotal-container-service` cloud-config after removing your <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> deployment,
including after removing the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> tile from Ops Manager.

#### <a id="1-14-0-ovsdb-server-failure"></a> Occasionally update-cluster Does Not Complete for Windows Workers

Occasionally, `tkgi update-cluster` hangs while updating a Windows worker node instance and the BOSH task cannot finish and exits.

**Symptom**

The `ovsdb-server` service has stopped but other processes report that it is running.

**Explanation**

The `ovsdb-server.pid` file uses the pid for a process that is not the ovsdb-server.

To confirm that this is the root cause for `tkgi update-cluster` to hang:

* To verify the `ovsdb-server` service has actually stopped, run the PowerShell `Get-services` command on the Windows worker node.
* To verify that other processes report the `ovsdb-server` service is still running:
<br>
    1. Review the ovsdb-server `job-service-wrapper.err.log` log file.
<br>
        The `job-service-wrapper.err.log` log file is located at:

        ```
        C:\var\vcap\sys\log\openvswitch-windows\ovsdb-server\job-service-wrapper.err.log
        ```
    1. Confirm that after the flushing processes, the log includes an error similar to the following:

        ```
        Pid-Guard : ovsdb-server is already runing, please stop it first
        At C:\var\vcap\jobs\openvswitch-windows\bin\ovsdb-server_ctl.ps1:30 char:5
        +     Pid-Guard $PIDFILE "ovsdb-server"
        +     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
            + CategoryInfo          : NotSpecified: ( [Write-Error], WriteErrorException
            + FullyQualifiedErrorId : Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.WriteErrorException,Pid-Guard
        ```
* To verify the root cause:
<br>
    1. Run the following PowerShell commands on the Windows worker node:

        ```
        $RUN_DIR = "C:\var\vcap\sys\run\openvswitch-windows"
        $PIDFILE = "$RUN_DIR\ovsdb-server.pid"
        $pid1 = Get-Content $PidFile -First 1
        echo $pid1
        $rst = Get-Process -Id $pid1 -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
        echo $rst
        ```
    1. Confirm the returned `ProcessName` is not `ovsdb-server`.

**Workaround**

To resolve this issue for a single Windows worker:

1. SSH to the affected worker node.
1. Run the following:

    ```
    rm C:\var\vcap\sys\run\openvswitch-windows\ovsdb-server.pid
    ```
1. Wait for the `ovsdb-server` process to start.
1. Confirm the dependent services also start.

Microsoft changed Microsoft Windows' support for tar file commands in the January 2022 Microsoft Windows security patch.

Packaging scripts that use tar commands for Windows worker-based Kubernetes Cluster deployments
can fail after the Microsoft tar command patch update has been applied.

The BOSH agent used by vSphere stemcells built by stembuild v2019.43 and earlier use tar commands that are no longer supported

#### <a id="1-14-0-csi-proxy-issue"></a> Automatic vSphere CSI Driver Integration Ignores Proxy Configuration

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.14.1](#1-14-1-bug-fixes).

In an environment configured with a proxy, automatic vSphere CSI Driver Integration ignores the configured proxy and fails.

**Symptom**

In environments configured with a Proxy and automatic **vSphere CSI Driver Integration** enabled,
the `csi-controller` and `csi-syncer` services log errors similar to the following and fail:

```
"caller":"vsphere/virtualcenter.go:154","msg":"failed to create new client with err: Post \"...\": dial tcp: lookup ...: no such host"
```

**Workaround**

To configure the vSphere CSI Driver to use your proxy:

1. SSH to <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Control Plane VM.

1. Open the `/var/vcap/jobs/csi-controller/bin/csi_controller_ctl` configuration file for editing.

1. Locate the `start_csi_controller` function in the configuration file:

    ```
    start_csi_controller()
    {
        ...
        export ...
        export ...
        export ...
        ...
    }
    ```
1. Locate the `export` commands in the `start_csi_controller` function
and add the following to the group of export commands:

    ```
    export HTTP_PROXY=HTTP-PROXY
    export HTTPS_PROXY=HTTPS-PROXY
    export NO_PROXY=NO-PROXY
    ```

    Where:

    * `HTTP-PROXY` is the HTTP Proxy that the vSphere CSI Driver must use.
    * `HTTPS-PROXY` is the HTTPS Proxy that the vSphere CSI Driver must use.
    * `NO-PROXY` is a list of host names that the vSphere CSI Driver should not use a proxy for.

1. Restart the `csi_controller`:

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.14.1](#1-14-1-bug-fixes).

**Symptom**

Your Windows clusters using the containerd container runtime in an air-gapped environment always attempt to pull the Windows pause image from
`projects-stg.registry.vmware.com/v2/tkg/pause/manifests/3.4.1-windows-amd64` instead of your designated Harbor registry.

Errors similar to the following are logged when the cluster fails to pull the Windows pause image:

```

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.14.1](#1-14-1-bug-fixes).

Clusters using the Docker container runtime no longer default to supporting Docker command line commands.

Supporting containerd as the default container runtime requires Docker-specific features incompatible with containerd are deactivated by default.

**Workaround**

In an environment where you want to run Docker commands, complete one of the following:

* Export the Docker environments variables before using Docker commands:

#### <a id="1-14-0-vm-extensions-toggle"></a> Custom BOSH vm_extensions Configuration Settings Applied Inconsistently to Cluster VMs

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.14.1](#1-14-1-bug-fixes).

A vm_extensions configuration will not be applied consistently to the VMs in a cluster
if the initial application of the configuration was interrupted by an error.

**Explanation**

A cluster will have an inconsistency between its cloud-config and BOSH manifest if the
initial application of a vm_extensions configuration is interrupted and fails.
The inconsistency results because BOSH rolls back manifest changes after an error occurs
but there is not a corresponding function that rolls back the cluster cloud-config changes.

Attempting to re-apply the vm_extensions configuration to the cluster has no effect because
the cluster cloud-config indicates the cluster has already been updated.

**Workaround**

1. To export the cloud-config of the cluster with vm_extensions configuration inconsistencies:

    ```
    bosh configs --type=cloud --name=BOSH-DEPLOYMENT > YAML-FILENAME
    ```

    Where:

    * `BOSH-DEPLOYMENT` is the `service-instance_`-prefixed BOSH deployment name.
    * `YAML-FILENAME` is the output YAML file name.

    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">
    bosh config --type=cloud --name=service-instance_cdd7f46b-3151-4d67-85a6-5531fa456b71 > service-instance_cdd7f46b-3151-4d67-85a6-5531fa456b71-cloud-config.yaml
    </pre>

1. (Optional) Create a backup of the cloud-config you just exported:

    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">
    cp service-instance_cdd7f46b-3151-4d67-85a6-5531fa456b71-cloud-config.yaml service-instance_cdd7f46b-3151-4d67-85a6-5531fa456b71-cloud-config-withextension.yaml
    </pre>

1. Open the exported cloud-config in an editor.
1. Remove the vm_extensions added by the interrupted vm_extensions configuration
that are tagged with "`master-vmext`" and "`worker-vmext`".

    You do not need to delete the default configuration tagged with "`master-nsgroup`"
    that was also added by the interrupted vm_extensions configuration.
1. Save your modified exported cloud-config.
1. Locate the UAA credentials for the environment.
See **Credentials** > **uaa_client_credentials** in the <%= vars.product_tile %> Tile.

1. Export `BOSH_CLIENT` and `BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET` using the UAA credentials collected above.

    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">export BOSH_CLIENT=pivotal-container-service-5531fa456b7185a646bc
    export BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET='4d6785a65531fa456c'
    </pre>

1. To update cluster specific cloud-config:

    ```
    bosh update-config --type=cloud --name=BOSH-DEPLOYMENT YAML-FILENAME
    ```

    Where:

    * `BOSH-DEPLOYMENT` is the `service-instance_`-prefixed BOSH deployment name.
    * `YAML-FILENAME` is your modified exported cloud-config YAML file name.

    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">bosh update-config --type=cloud --name=service-instance_cdd7f46b-3151-4d67-85a6-5531fa456b71 service-instance_cdd7f46b-3151-4d67-85a6-5531fa456b71-cloud-config.yaml</pre>

1. To update the cluster recreate VMs with the correct manifest:

    ```
    tkgi update-cluster CLUSTER-NAME --config-file CONFIG-FILENAME
    ```

    Where:

    * `CLUSTER-NAME` is the name of your cluster.

#### <a id="1-14-0-vmdks-deleted-during-migration"></a> VMDKs Are Deleted during Migration from In-Tree Storage to CSI

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.14.1](#1-14-1-bug-fixes). 

While migrating a cluster from using the In-Tree vSphere Storage Driver to the automatically installed vSphere CSI Driver, 
VMDKs attached to worker VMs might be deleted.

#### <a id="1-14-0-healthwatch-metrics"></a> Healthwatch Unable to Scrape Kube Scheduler Metrics

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.14.2](#1-14-2-bug-fixes).

**Symptom**  

After upgrading to <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.14, Healthwatch fails to scrape Kube Scheduler metrics 
and logs errors similar to the following:  

```
caller=scrape.go:1294 level=debug component="scrape manager" scrape_pool=tkgi-cluster-scheduler target=... msg="Scrape failed" err="server returned HTTP status 403 Forbidden"
```

**Explanation**  

Changes in Kubernetes 1.23 require the addition of new parameters in order to make the Kube Scheduler metrics endpoint available externally. 
The Kube Scheduler process also uses a different port than previous TKGI versions. 
Healthwatch is unable to scrape Kube Scheduler metrics using the existing default Healthwatch configuration.  

**Workaround**

On each Kubernetes cluster Control Plane node that you want to monitor:  

1. Make backup copies of the `/var/vcap/jobs/kube-scheduler/config/bpm.yml` 
and `/var/vcap/jobs/metrics-sink/config/telegraf.conf` configuration files.  
1. Edit the `/var/vcap/jobs/kube-scheduler/config/bpm.yml` YAML file.  
1. Add the following to the `args:` section in the configuration file:  

    ```
    "--authentication-kubeconfig=/var/vcap/jobs/kube-scheduler/config/kubeconfig"
    "--authorization-kubeconfig=/var/vcap/jobs/kube-scheduler/config/kubeconfig"
    ```

1. Save your changes.  
1. Edit the `/var/vcap/jobs/metrics-sink/config/telegraf.conf` configuration file.  
1. Add a new Kube Scheduler metrics scraper under the existing `inputs` section in the configuration file:  

    ```
    ## Kube Scheduler Metrics
    [[inputs.prometheus]]
    urls = ["
    [https://localhost:10259/metrics]
    "]
    metric_version = 2
    insecure_skip_verify = true
    tls_cert = "/var/vcap/jobs/metric-sink/config/monitoring_metric_cert.pem"
    tls_key = "/var/vcap/jobs/metric-sink/config/monitoring_metric_cert.key"
    ```
    
1. Save your changes.
1. In Healthwatch's Grafana, import the modified "Kubernetes Scheduler" dashboard configuration file.  
1. In Healthwatch's Grafana, import the modified "Kubernetes Cluster Detail" dashboard configuration file.  

If BOSH later updates the Kubernetes Cluster Control Plane, you must reconfigure the `kube-scheduler bpm.yml` 
and the metrics-sink `telegraf.conf` file for every master node in each cluster.

#### <a id="1-14-0-coredns-downtime"></a> Cluster Workloads Experience Downtime While Upgrading and Switching Container Runtimes

<%# This issue is fixed in [< %= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr % > v1.14.3](#1-14-3-bug-fixes). #%>

The workloads on a cluster will experience a period of downtime if the cluster runtime is automatically switched from Docker to containerd 
during a <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> upgrade.  

**Explanation**  

By default, clusters are switched from the Docker container runtime to containerd while upgrading <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> to a newer <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> version.  

If a <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> upgrade switches a cluster container runtime, the workloads on that cluster will experience a period of downtime.  

Administrators have the option to switch container runtimes manually before upgrading <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>. 
Administrators can also tag a cluster to not switch container runtimes automatically during a <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> upgrade.  

**Workaround**

To avoid workload downtime, manually switch the cluster's container runtime to containerd before upgrading to <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.14
or configure the cluster so that the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> upgrade does not switch the cluster's container runtime.  

If you must allow the container runtime switch to occur during a <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> upgrade, 
avoid workload downtime by completing the following steps before upgrading to <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.14:  

1. Pull down the coreDNS image used in your <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.13 Kubernetes clusters.  

    * If you are upgrading <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> from v1.13.2 through v1.13.6 to <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.14.0 and later:  
    
        ```
        docker pull projects.registry.vmware.com/tkg/coredns:v1.8.4_vmware.7
        ```  
        
    * If you are upgrading from <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.13.0 or v1.13.1 to <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.14.0 and later:  
    
        1. SSH to one of the worker nodes.  
        1. Use the following `alias docker` command:  
        
            ```
            alias docker="/var/vcap/packages/docker/bin/docker --host unix:///var/vcap/sys/run/docker/docker.sock"
            ```
            
        1. Export the coreDNS image using [`docker save`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/save/).  
            
1. Upload the coreDNS image to your custom image registry.  
1. Modify the coreDNS deployment to use the uploaded image. 
Repeat this step for all of the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Kubernetes clusters with workloads that should remain up during the upgrade.  
1. Upgrade <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> from v1.13 to <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.14.  

    During worker upgrades the coreDNS image in the custom image registry is available, avoiding coreDNS downtime. 
    After upgrading a cluster, the workers use the coreDNS version installed by the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> upgrade.

#### <a id="1-14-0-docker-image-not-removed"></a> The Docker Image Remains after Switching to the Containerd Container Runtime

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.14.2](#1-14-2-bug-fixes).  

The Docker image is not automatically removed after successfully switching a cluster from the Docker container runtime to containerd.  

**Workaround**

To remove a Docker image after switching a cluster's container runtime:  

1. Manually remove the cluster's `/var/vcap/store/docker` directory.

#### <a id="1-14-0-vrops-not-running"></a> vROPs cAdvisor Daemonset Is Not Running after Upgrading <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.14.2](#1-14-2-bug-fixes).  

After upgrading <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> to <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.14.0, 
the vROPs cAdvisor daemonset cannot be deployed on clusters 
with Pod Security Policy (PSP) enabled. 

**Symptom**  

The vROPs cAdvisor daemonset does not deploy on a cluster and errors similar to the following are logged:

```
Warning FailedCreate... daemonset-controller Error creating: pods "..." is forbidden: PodSecurityPolicy: unable to admit pod:
```  


**Workaround**

To restart vROPs cAdvisor daemonset:  

1. Open the cluster's PSP configuration in an editor.  
1. Configure `privileged: true` and `allowPrivilegeEscalation: true` in the `spec` settings.  
<br>
    For example:  

    ```
    ---
    apiVersion: policy/v1beta1
    kind: PodSecurityPolicy
    metadata:
      name: a-vrops-psp
    spec:
      privileged: true
      allowPrivilegeEscalation: true
    ....
    ```

1. Save your edits and update the cluster with the revised configuration file.

#### <a id="1-14-0-large-docker-timeout"></a> Timeout While Switching Container Runtimes If the Docker Directory Is Too Large 

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.14.3](#1-14-3-bug-fixes).  

Switching a cluster's container runtime from Docker to containerd can timeout and fail 
if the Docker directory contains many files.  

**Description**

A timeout occurs during the `remove Docker` step while switching a cluster's container runtime 
from Docker to containerd if the Docker directory contains too many files to delete within 
the 180-second timeout interval.  

**Workaround**

To work around this issue:  

1. Manually remove the `/var/vcap/store/docker` directory.  
1. Re-start the process that stopped due to the time out.

#### <a id="1-14-0-pv-not-attached-to-new-node"></a> Persistent Volumes Fail to Detach from Nodes

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.14.3](#1-14-3-bug-fixes).  

If a Pod is recreated in a new instance node, the persistent volume might remain attached to the old node.  

**Symptom**  

A persistent volume remains attached to an old node, and attachment errors similar to the following are logged:  

```
Warning FailedMount... kubelet Unable to attach or mount volumes: unmounted volumes=..., unattached volumes=...: timed out waiting for the condition
Warning FailedMount... kubelet Unable to attach or mount volumes: unmounted volumes=..., unattached volumes=...: timed out waiting for the condition

#### <a id="1-14-0-crashloopbackoff-after-containerd"></a> Pods on Clusters Using the containerd-Runtime Enter a CrashLoopBackOff State

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.14.3](#1-14-3-bug-fixes).  

Pods in a cluster that has been switched from the Docker container runtime to containerd might enter a CrashLoopBackOff state. 
If the container runtime switch is part of a cluster upgrade, the upgrade halts.  

**Symptom**

The Pods that have entered the CrashLoopBackOff state log the following:

```
Warning FailedCreatePodSandBox... Failed to create pod sandbox: rpc error: code = 
Unknown desc = failed to create containerd task: failed to start shim: 
write /var/vcap/sys/run/containerd/io.containerd.runtime.v2.task/.../config.json:

#### <a id="1-14-0-csi-driver-missing"></a> CSI Driver Image Missing After High Disk Utilization

<% if vars.product_version == "COMMENTED"  %>
This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.14.5](#1-14-5-bug-fixes).  

<% end %>
The CSI driver can be missing on a worker node in an air-gapped environment after the reaching a state of high disk utilization.

**Explanation**

A garbage collection event to increase storage capacity is triggered when a worker node's storage reaches a state of low available disk capacity. 
The garbage collector deletes unused image files and deletes the CSI driver image. In an air-gapped environment, a replacement CSI driver image cannot be pulled.

#### <a id="management-console-1-14-0-vsphere-ha"></a> vSphere HA causes Management Console ovfenv Data Corruption

**Symptom**

If you enable vSphere HA on a cluster, if the TKGI Management Console appliance VM is running on a
host in that cluster, and if the host reboots, vSphere HA recreates a new TKGI Management Console
appliance VM on another host in the cluster. Due to an issue with vSphere HA, the `ovfenv` data for
the newly created appliance VM is corrupted and the new appliance VM does not boot up with the
correct network configuration.

**Workaround**

1. In the vSphere Client, right-click the appliance VM and select **Power** > **Shut Down Guest OS**.
1. Right-click the appliance again and select Edit Settings.
1. Select **VM Options** and click **OK**.
1. Verify under Recent Tasks that a `Reconfigure virtual machine` task has run on the appliance VM.
1. Power on the appliance VM.

the Kubernetes profile, some file arguments are not decoded.

**Workaround**

Run `echo "$content" | base64 --decode`

<hr>

#### <a id="management-console-1-14-0-network-profile"></a> Network profiles not immediately selectable

**Symptom**

If you create network profiles and then try to apply them in the Create Cluster page, the new
profiles are not available for selection.

**Workaround**

Log out of the management console and log back in again.

<hr>

#### <a id="management-console-1-14-0-cluster-summary"></a> Real-Time IP information not displayed for network profiles

**Symptom**

In the cluster summary page, only default IP pool, pod IP block, node IP block values are displayed,
rather than the real-time values from the associated network profile.

**Workaround**

None

#### <a id="management-console-1-14-0-re-import-windows-stemcell"></a> Windows Stemcells Must be Re-Imported After Upgrading Ops Manager

**Symptom**

After upgrading Ops Manager, your Management Console does not recognize a Windows stemcell imported
when using the prior version of Ops Manager.

**Workaround**

If your Management Console does not recognize a Windows stemcell after upgrading Ops Manager:

1. Re-import your previously imported Windows stemcell.
2. **Apply Changes** to <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> MC.

<hr>

#### <a id="management-console-1-14-0-cluster-group-name"></a> Your New Clusters Are Not Shown In Tanzu Mission Control

**Symptom**

After you create a cluster, Tanzu Mission Control does not include the cluster in cluster lists.
You have a "_Resource not found_" error similar to the following in your BOSH logs:

```
Cluster Name in TMC: cluster-1
Cluster Name Prefix: tkgi-my-prefix-
Group Name in TMC: my-prefix-clusters
Cluster Description in TMC: VMware Enterprise PKS Attaching cluster ''tkgi-my-prefix-cluster-1'' to TMC
Fetching token successful

response 404 Not Found:{"error":"Resource not found - clustergroup(my-prefix-clusters)
org id(d859dc9f-g622-426d-8c91-939a9f13dea9)",
"code":5,"message":"Resource not found - clustergroup(my-prefix-clusters)
```

**Explanation**

The cluster group you assign a cluster to must be defined in Tanzu Mission Control
before you assign your cluster to the cluster group in the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Management Console.

**Workaround**

To resolve the problem, complete the steps in
[Attaching a Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated (TKGI) cluster to Tanzu Mission Control (TMC) fails with "Resource not found - clustergroup(cluster-group-name)"](https://community.pivotal.io/s/article/tkgi-tmc-attach-fail)
