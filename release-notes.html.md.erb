### <a id='1-9-0-upgrade'></a>Upgrade Path

The supported upgrade paths to <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.9.0 are from <%= vars.product_short %> v1.8.0 and later.

### <a id="1-9-0-features"></a>Features

This section describes new features and changes in <%= vars.product_full %> v1.9.0.

#### <a id="1-9-0-certs"></a>Cluster Certificate Rotation Support

For secure communication, <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> clusters use TLS certificates created unique for each cluster.
<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.9.0 integrates with the [CredHub Maestro](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/security/pcf-infrastructure/getting-started-with-maestro-cli.html) CLI to enable expiry checks and rotation for these cluster-specific certificates, including additional certificates that clusters use with NSX-T networking.

See [Rotating Cluster Certificates](./rotate-cluster-certificates.html) for how to check and rotate cluster-specific certificates,
and [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Certificates](./certificate-concepts.html) for managing all certificates used by <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>.

#### <a id="1-9-0-certs-local-bundle"></a>PKS CLI Supports Certificates Trusted by the Local System

The PKS CLI now trusts the certificates in a system CA store, such as the MacOS keychain. 
When logging in to the PKS CLI, you no longer need to specify the `--skip-ssl-validation` or `--ca-cert` command line arguments.  

#### <a id="1-9-0-windows"></a>Windows Workers on NSX-T

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.9.0 supports clusters with Windows-based worker nodes on vSphere with NSX-T networking only.
<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.9.0 continues to support Windows workloads on vSphere with Flannel networking as a beta feature.
 
#### <a id="1-9-0-compute-profiles"></a>Compute Profile CLI Support and Improvements (vSphere)

Compute profiles let developers customize cluster topology, node sizing, and other compute resource options, overriding configurations that a cluster inherits from its Plan.

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.9.0 redesigns and improves compute profile functionality, and adds TKG CLI options for creating, managing, and using compute profiles.

With NSX-T networking you can use compute profiles with Linux- and Windows-worker clusters.
With Flannel networking you can only apply compute profiles to Linux clusters.

For more information, see [Creating and Managing Compute Profiles with the CLI (vSphere)](./compute-profiles-manage.html).


#### <a id="1-9-0-tagging"></a>Tagging Support on AWS and GCP 

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> supports tagging from the CLI on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
This enables the `--tags` option to `tkgi create-cluster` and other commands on all infrastructures.

For more information, see [Tagging Clusters](./tag-clusters.html).


#### <a id="1-9-0-velero"></a>Velero Support and Bundling for Backup and Restore

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.9.0 includes support for [Velero](https://velero.io/docs), an open source community standard tool for backing up and restoring Kubernetes clusters and persistent volumes.
Velero is the preferred backup solution for <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> clusters, and is downloadable from your <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> downloads page on https://my.vmware.com.


#### <a id="1-9-0-telegraf"></a>New Telegraf Configuration Fields

TBD

#### <a id="1-9-0-telemetry"></a>Telemetry Changes

* **Telemetry Enhanced Participation Level Change**: 
The <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Customer Experience Improvement Program (CEIP) and Telemetry Program has been streamlined to bring the Enhanced participation level closer to the Standard participation level.
For descriptions of the participation levels, see [Telemetry](./telemetry.html).

* **Telemetry Database Removal**: 
The legacy Telemetry DB has been removed from the <%= vars.control_plane_db %>. 

#### <a id="1-9-0-component-updates"></a>Component Updates

The following components have been updated:

* Bumps Kubernetes to v1.18.6.
* Bumps CoreDNS to v1.6.5

* TBD
* TBD


###<a id='1-9-0-known-issues'></a>Known Issues

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.9.0 has the following known issues:

#### <a id="1.9.0-vrops-windows-clusters"></a> VMware vRealize Operations Does Not Support Windows Worker-Based Kubernetes Clusters

VMware vRealize Operations (vROPs) does not support Windows worker-based Kubernetes clusters and cannot be used to 
manage <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>-provisioned Windows workers.  


#### <a id='1-9-0-wavefront-no-win'></a><%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Wavefront Does Not Work for Windows Workers

The Wavefront collector and proxy do not support monitoring of clusters with Windows-based worker nodes.
For alternative ways to set up in-cluster monitoring, see [Monitoring Workers and Workloads](./in-cluster-monitoring.html).

#### <a id='1-9-0-ping'></a>Pinging Windows Workers Does Not Work

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>-provisioned Windows workers inherit a Kubernetes limitation that prevents
outbound ICMP communication from workers.
As a result, pinging Windows workers does not work.

For information about this limitation, see [Limitations > Networking](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/windows/intro-windows-in-kubernetes/#networking-1)
in the _Windows in Kubernetes_ documentation.

#### <a id="1.9.0-windows-velero-limitations"></a> Velero Does Not Support Backing Up Stateful Windows Workloads

You can use Velero to backup stateless <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>-provisioned Windows workers. 
Velero can back up stateless Windows workloads only, and cannot be used to backup stateful Windows applications. 
For more information, see [Velero on Windows](https://velero.io/docs/v1.4/basic-install/#velero-on-windows) in 
_Basic Install_ in the Velero documentation.

#### <a id="1-9-0-tmc-on-gcp"></a>TMC Integration Not Supported on GCP

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) does not support
Tanzu Mission Control integration, which is configured in
the **<%= vars.product_tile %>** tile > the **Tanzu Mission Control (Experimental)** pane.

If you intend to run <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.8 on GCP,
skip this pane when configuring the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile.

#### <a id="1-9-0-old-profile-no-cli"></a>Compute Profile CLI Commands Do Not Support Pre-v1.9 Profiles

Compute profiles created in <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.8 and earlier have a different format from v1.9 compute profiles, as described in [Compute Profile CLI Support and Improvements (vSphere)](#1-9-0-compute-profiles).

You cannot use the v1.9 `tkgi` CLI compute profile commands to manage compute profiles created in prior versions of <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>.
To perform compute profile operations on pre-v1.9 profiles and the clusters that use them, use the `curl` commands and JSON structure described in [Using Compute Profiles](https://docs.pivotal.io/tkgi/1-8/compute-profiles.html) in the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.8 documentation.

Compute profiles created in prior versions of <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>, and the clusters that use them, continue to work in v1.9.

#### <a id="1-9-0-profile-no-win-flannel"></a>Compute Profiles Not Supported with for Windows-Worker Clusters on Flannel

On vSphere with Flannel networking, you can only apply compute profiles to Linux clusters.
On vSphere with NSX-T networking you can use compute profiles with both Linux- and Windows-worker clusters.

#### <a id="1-9-0-oidc-response-header"></a>502 Bad Gateway After OIDC Login  

**Symptom**  

You experience a "502 Bad Gateway" error from the NSX load balancer after you log in to OIDC.  

**Explanation**  

A large response header has exceeded your NSX-T load balancer maximum 
response header size. The default maximum response header size is 10,240 characters and should 
be resized to 50,000.  

**Workaround**  

If you experience this issue, manually reconfigure your NSX-T `request_header_size` 
and `response_header_size` to 50,000 characters. 
For information about configuring NSX-T default header sizes, 
see [OIDC Response Header Overflow](https://community.pivotal.io/s/article/OIDC-Response-Header-overflow) in the Knowledge Base.  

#### <a id='1-9-0-uuid-length'></a> One Plan ID Longer than Other Plan IDs  

**Symptom**  

One of your plan IDs is one character longer than your other plan IDs.  

**Explanation**  

In <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>, each plan has a unique plan ID.
A plan ID is normally a UUID consisting of 32 alphanumeric characters and 4 hyphens. 
However, the **Plan 4** ID consists of 33 alphanumeric characters and 4 hyphens.  

**Solution**  

You can safely configure and use **Plan 4**. 
The length of the **Plan 4** ID does not affect the functionality of **Plan 4** clusters.  

If you require all plan IDs to have identical length, do not activate or use **Plan 4**.  

#### <a id='1-9-0-eight-cores-error'></a> NSX-T Pre-Check Errand Fails Due to Edge Node Configuration  

**Symptom**  

You have configured your NSX-T Edge Node VM as `medium` size, 
and the NSX-T Pre-Check Errand fails with the following error: 
"_ERROR: NSX-T Precheck failed due to Edge Node ... no of cpu cores is less than 8_". 

**Explanation**  

The NSX-T Pre-Check Errand is erroneously returning the "_cpu cores is less than 8_" error.

**Solution**  

You can safely configure your NSX-T Edge Node VMs as `medium` size and ignore the error. 

#### <a id='1-9-0-windows-proxy'></a> Difficulty Changing Proxy for Windows Workers

You must configure a global proxy in the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile > **Networking** pane before you create any Windows workers that use the proxy.

You cannot change the proxy configuration for Windows workers in an existing cluster.

#### <a id='1-9-0-http-proxy-password'></a> Character Limitations in HTTP Proxy Password

For vSphere with NSX-T, the HTTP Proxy password field does not support the following special characters: `&` or `;`.

### <a id='management-console-1-9-0-upgrade'></a>Upgrade Path

The supported upgrade path to <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console v1.9.0 is from 
<%= vars.product_short %> v1.8.0 and later.

### <a id="management-console-1.9.0-known-issues"></a> Known Issues

The <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console v1.9.0 has the following known issues:

#### <a id="management-console-1.9.0-vrli-https"></a> vRealize Log Insight Integration Does Not Support HTTPS Connections

**Symptom**

The <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console integration to vRealize Log Insight does not support connections to the HTTPS port on the vRealize Log Insight server. 

**Workaround**

1. Use SSH to log in to the <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console appliance VM.
1. Open the file `/lib/systemd/system/pks-loginsight.service` in a text editor.
1. Add `-e LOG_SERVER_ENABLE_SSL_VERIFY=false`.  
1. Set `-e LOG_SERVER_USE_SSL=true`. 
   
    The resulting file should look like the following example:
       
    ```
    ExecStart=/bin/docker run --privileged --restart=always --network=pks 
    -v /var/log/journal:/var/log/journal 
    --name=pks-loginsight 
    -e TYPE=gear2-vm 
    -e LOG_SERVER_HOST=${LOGINSIGHT_HOST} 
    -e LOG_SERVER_PORT=${LOGINSIGHT_PORT} 
    -e LOG_SERVER_ENABLE_SSL_VERIFY=false 
    -e LOG_SERVER_USE_SSL=true 
    -e LOG_SERVER_AGENT_ID=${LOGINSIGHT_ID} 
    pksoctopus/vrli-journald:v07092019
    ```      
   
1. Save the file and run `systemctl daemon-reload`.
1. To restart the vRealize Log Insight service, run `systemctl restart pks-loginsight.service`.
 
<%= vars.product_short %> Management Console can now send logs to the HTTPS port on the vRealize Log Insight server.

#### <a id="management-console-1.9.0-vsphere-ha"></a> vSphere HA causes Management Console ovfenv Data Corruption

**Symptom**

If you enable vSphere HA on a cluster, if the TKGI Management Console appliance VM is running on a host in that cluster, and if the host reboots, vSphere HA recreates a new TKGI Management Console appliance VM on another host in the cluster. Due to an issue with vSphere HA, the `ovfenv` data for the newly created appliance VM is corrupted and the new appliance VM does not boot up with the correct network configuration. 

**Workaround**

- In the vSphere Client, right-click the appliance VM and select **Power** > **Shut Down Guest OS**.
- Right-click the appliance again and select Edit Settings.
- Select **VM Options** and click **OK**.
- Verify under Recent Tasks that a `Reconfigure virtual machine` task has run on the appliance VM.
- Power on the appliance VM.

#### <a id="management-console-1.9.0-k8s-profile"></a> Base64 encoded file arguments are not decoded in Kubernetes profiles

**Symptom**

Some file arguments in Kubernetes profiles are base64 encoded. When the management console displays the Kubernetes profile,
some file arguments are not decoded.

**Workaround**

Run `echo "$content" | base64 --decode` 

#### <a id="management-console-1.9.0-network-profile"></a> Network profiles not immediately selectable

**Symptom**

If you create network profiles and then try to apply them in the Create Cluster page, the new profiles 
are not available for selection. 

**Workaround**

Log out of the management console and log back in again.

#### <a id="management-console-1.9.0-cluster-summary"></a> Real-Time IP information not displayed for network profiles

**Symptom**

In the cluster summary page, only default IP pool, pod IP block, node IP block values are displayed, 
rather than the real-time values from the associated network profile. 

**Workaround**

None
