### <a id="v1.2.0-beta-1-known-issues"></a>Known Issues

* If you use stemcell v3586.18 or later
in the 3586 line of Linux stemcells
when deploying PKS on GCP, you may see the following:

  * The output of the `bosh vms` command
  shows an error message that includes `unresponsive agent`.
  * Your PKS-provisioned Kubernetes cluster does not respond to any PKS CLI commands,
  such as `pks get-credentials` or `pks delete-cluster`.

    Until this issue is resolved,
    use stemcell v3586.16 when deploying PKS on GCP.
