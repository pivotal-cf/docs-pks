### <a id="v1.3.2-upgrade"></a>Upgrade Path

The supported upgrade paths to PKS v1.3.2 are as follows:

- **When upgrading from PKS v1.3.x**: PKS 1.3.1
- **When upgrading from PKS v1.2.x**: PKS v1.2.8 or v1.2.9

### <a id="v1.3.2-whats-new"></a>What's New

PKS v1.3.2 adds the following:

- **Fix**: [CVE-2019-5736](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-5736). This fix updates the version of Docker deployed by PKS to v18.06.2-ce. This Docker version addresses a runc vulnerability whereby a malicious image could run in privileged mode and elevate to root access on worker nodes.
- **Fix**: [CVE-2019-3779](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-3779). This fix addresses a vulnerability where certs signed by the Kubernetes API could be used to gain access to a PKS-deployed cluster's etcd service.
- **Fix**: [CVE-2019-3780](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-3780). This fixes a regression bug in PKS where vCenter IaaS credentials intended for the vSphere Cloud Provider were written on worker node VM disks.
- **Fix**: Clusters can now be successfully created if there are pre-existing Kubernetes clusters using the same hostname.

### <a id="v1.3.2-known-issues"></a>Breaking Changes and Known Issues

<p class="note breaking"><strong>Breaking Change:</strong> Heapster is deprecated in PKS v1.3.x, and
Kubernetes has retired Heapster. For more information, see the
<a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-retired/heapster">kubernetes-retired/heapster</a>
repository on GitHub.</p>

PKS v1.3.2 has the following known issues:

####<a id="flannel"></a> PKS Flannel Network Gets Out of Sync with Docker Bridge Network (cni0)

When VMs have been powered down for multiple days, turning them back on and issuing a `bosh recreate` to recreate the VMs causes the pods to get stuck in a `ContainerCreating` state.

**Workaround**: See [PKS Flannel network gets out of sync with docker bridge network (cni0)](https://community.pivotal.io/s/article/PKS-Flannel-network-gets-out-of-sync-with-docker-bridge-network-cni0) in the Pivotal Knowledge Base.

####<a id="special-char"></a> Deploy Fails if vSphere Master Credentials Field Has Special Characters Without Quotes

If you install PKS on vSphere, and you enter credentials in the **vCenter Master Credentials** field of the **Kubernetes Cloud Provider** pane of the PKS tile that contain special characters, such as `#`, `$`, `,`, `!`, or `-`, your deployment can fail with the following error:

```
ServerFaultCode: Cannot complete login due to an incorrect user name or password.
```

To temporarily resolve this issue if NSX-T is NOT deployed, place quotes around the credentials in the cloud provider configuration. For example, `"SomeP4$$w0rd#!"`. Then redeploy the PKS tile by clicking **Apply Changes**.


####<a id="azure-service"></a> Cluster Upgrades from 1.3.0 may fail on Azure if services are exposed

Customers deploying PKS to Azure can experience a cluster failing when upgrading the cluster from 1.3.0 to 1.3.1 or 1.3.2.  The error `result: 1 of 2 post-start scripts failed. Failed Jobs: kubelet. Successful Jobs: bosh-dns` message is a symptom.  This issue is due to a timeout condition for nodes that are hosting Kubernetes pods that are exposed externally via a Kubernetes service.  New cluster creations or cluster scale operations are not affected.    If customers deploying PKS to Azure experience this scenario they are advised to contact Support for assistance until it is resolved in a patch release.

### <a id="v1.3.1-upgrade"></a>Upgrade Path

The supported upgrade paths to PKS v1.3.1 are as follows:

- **When upgrading from PKS v1.3.x**: PKS 1.3.0
- **When upgrading from PKS v1.2.x**: PKS v1.2.7 or v1.2.8

### <a id="v1.3.1-whats-new"></a>What's New

PKS v1.3.1 adds support for the following:

- Certificates for the Etcd instance for each Kubernetes cluster provisioned by PKS are generated with a four-year lifetime and signed by a new Etcd Certificate Authority (CA). 
* **Fix**: Upgrading PKS no longer fails during upgrades if there are Kubernetes clusters with duplicate hostnames.
* **Fix**: Deploying PKS no longer fails if an entry in the **No Proxy** field contains special characters such as (`-`) character.
* **Fix**: The Kubernetes API now responds with the CA certificate that signed the Kubernetes cluster's certificate so that customer scripts such as the [get-pks-k8s-config.sh](https://community.pivotal.io/s/article/script-to-automate-generation-of-the-kubeconfig-for-the-kubernetes-user) tool will function again.

### <a id="v1.3.0-upgrade"></a>Upgrade Path

The supported upgrade paths to PKS v1.3.0 are from PKS v1.2.5 and later.

For more information, see [Upgrading PKS](upgrade-pks.html) and [Upgrading PKS with NSX-T](upgrade-pks-nsxt.html).

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Upgrading from PKS v1.2.5+ to PKS v1.3.x causes all certificates to be automatically regenerated. The old certificate authority is still trusted, and has a validity of one year. But the new certificates are signed with a new certificate authority, which is valid for four years.</p>

### <a id="v1.3.0-whats-new"></a>What's New

PKS v1.3.0 adds the following:

- Support for PKS on Azure. For more information, see [Azure](azure-index.html).
- BOSH Backup and Restore (BBR) for single-master clusters. For more information, see [Backing up the Single Master Cluster](bbr-backup-cluster.html) and [Restoring the Single Master Cluster](bbr-restore-cluster.html).
- Routable pods on NSX-T. For more information, see [Routable Pod Networks](network-profiles-define.html#routable-pods) in <em>Defining Network Profiles</em>.
- Large size NSX-T load balancers with Bare Metal NSX-T edge nodes. For more information, see [Hardware Requirements for PKS on vSphere with NSX-T](vsphere-nsxt-rpd-mpd.html#pks-edge-cluster).
- HTTP proxy for NSX-T components. For more information, see [Using Proxies with PKS on NSX-T](proxies.html).
- Ability to specify the size of the Pods IP Block subnet using a network profile. For more information, see [Pod Subnet Prefix](./network-profiles-define.html#pod-prefix) in <em>Defining Network Profiles</em>.
- Support for bootstrap security groups, custom floating IPs, and edge router selection using network profiles. For more information, see [Bootstrap Security Group](network-profiles-define.html#ns-groups), [Custom Floating IP Pool](network-profiles-define.html#floating-ip), and [Edge Router Selection](network-profiles-define.html#multi-t0) in <em>Defining Network Profiles</em>.
- Support for sink resources in air-gapped environments.
- Support for creating sink resources with the PKS Command Line Interface (PKS CLI). For more information, see [Creating Sink Resources](create-sinks.html).
- Sink resources include both pod logs as well as events from the Kubernetes API. These events are combined in a shared format that provides operators with a robust set of filtering and monitoring options. For more information, see [Monitoring PKS with Sinks](monitor-sinks.html).
- Support for multiple NSX-T Tier-0 (T0) logical routers for use with PKS multi-tenant environments. For more information, see [Configuring Multiple Tier-0 Routers for Tenant Isolation](nsxt-multi-t0.html).
- Support for multiple PKS foundations on the same NSX-T. For more information, see [Implementing a Multi-Foundation PKS Deployment](nsxt-multi-pks.html). 
- Smoke tests errand that uses the PKS CLI to create a Kubernetes cluster and then delete it. If the creation or deletion fails, the errand fails and the installation of the PKS tile is aborted. For more information, see the <em>Errands</em> section of the <em>Installing PKS</em> topic for your IaaS, such as [Installing PKS on vSphere](installing-pks-vsphere.html#errands).
- Support for scaling down the number of worker nodes. For more information, see [Scaling Existing Clusters](scale-clusters.html).
- Support for defining the CIDR range for Kubernetes pods and services on Flannel networks. For more information, see the <em>Networking</em> section of the <em>Installing PKS</em> topic for your IaaS, such as [Installing PKS on vSphere](installing-pks-vsphere.html#networking).
- Kubernetes v1.12.4.  
- **Bug Fix**: The **No Proxy** property for vSphere now accepts wildcard domains like
`*.example.com` and `example.com`. See [Networking](./installing-pks-vsphere.html#networking) in
_Installing PKS on vSphere_ for more information.
- **Bug Fix**: The issue with NSX-T where special characters in username and password doesn't work is resolved.
- **Security Fix**: [CVE 2018-18264](https://pivotal.io/security/cve-2018-18264): This CVE allows unauthenticated secret access to the Kubernetes Dashboard.
- **Security Fix**: [CVE-2018-15759](https://pivotal.io/security/cve-2018-15759): This CVE contains an insecure method of verifying credentials. A remote unauthenticated malicious user may make many requests to the service broker with a series of different credentials, allowing them to infer valid credentials and gain access to perform broker operations.

### <a id="v1.3.0-known-issues"></a>Breaking Changes and Known Issues

<p class="note breaking"><strong>Breaking Change:</strong> Heapster is deprecated in PKS v1.3, and
Kubernetes has retired Heapster. For more information, see the
<a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-retired/heapster">kubernetes-retired/heapster</a>
repository on GitHub.</p>

PKS v1.3.0 has the following known issues:

#### <a id="duplicate-external-host"></a>Upgrades Fail When Clusters Share an External Hostname

If you use the same external hostname across more than one PKS-deployed Kubernetes
cluster, upgrades from PKS v1.2.x to PKS v1.3.0 can fail. The external hostname is
the value you set with either the `-e` or `--external-hostname` argument when you
created the cluster. For more information, see [Create a Kubernetes Cluster](./create-cluster.html#create).

PKS v1.3.0 introduces restrictions that prevent you from deploying clusters with
duplicate hostnames, so this issue does not affect upgrades from PKS v1.3.0 and
later.

If you have existing clusters that use the same external hostname, do not upgrade
to PKS v1.3.x. Contact your Support representative for more information.

#### <a id="no-proxy"></a>Upgrades Fail with a Hyphen in the No Proxy Field on vSphere

If you install PKS on vSphere and you enable the **HTTP/HTTPS Proxy** setting, you
cannot use the `-` character in the **No Proxy** field. Entering `-` in the **No
Proxy** field can cause validation errors when trying to upgrade to PKS v1.3.0.
For more information, see the [Networking](./installing-pks-vsphere.html#networking) section of
_Installing PKS on vSphere_.

If you experience this issue during an upgrade, contact Support for a hotfix
that will be applied in a future PKS v1.3.x release.

####<a id="flannel"></a> PKS Flannel Network Gets Out of Sync with Docker Bridge Network (cni0)

When VMs have been powered down for multiple days, turning them back on and issuing a `bosh recreate` to recreate the VMs causes the pods to get stuck in a `ContainerCreating` state.

**Workaround**: See [PKS Flannel network gets out of sync with docker bridge network (cni0)](https://community.pivotal.io/s/article/PKS-Flannel-network-gets-out-of-sync-with-docker-bridge-network-cni0) in the Pivotal Knowledge Base.

####<a id="special-char"></a> Deploy Fails if vSphere Master Credentials Field Has Special Characters Without Quotes

If you install PKS on vSphere, and you enter credentials in the **vCenter Master Credentials** field of the **Kubernetes Cloud Provider** pane of the PKS tile that contain special characters, such as `#`, `$`, `,`, `!`, or `-`, your deployment can fail with the following error:

```
ServerFaultCode: Cannot complete login due to an incorrect user name or password.
```

To resolve this issue, place quotes around the credentials. For example, `"SomeP4$$w0rd#!"`. Then redeploy the PKS tile by clicking **Apply Changes**.
