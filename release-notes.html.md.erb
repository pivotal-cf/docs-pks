#### <a id='1-9-5-drain-dynamic-pvs'></a> Workloads Using Dynamic PVs Must be Removed Before Deleting a Cluster

<%# This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr % > v1.9.6](#1-9-6-features). #%>

**Symptom**  

Your `tkgi delete-cluster` operation hangs while draining a worker VM containing a Pod bound to one or more dynamic persistent volumes.  

**Workaround** 

Before deleting the cluster, remove all workloads.

If you have already attempted to delete a cluster and your workloads with dynamic PVs have stopped, 
remove the dynamic PVs attached to the worker VMs in your cluster. 
For information about removing dynamic PVs from a worker VM, see 
[Workloads using dynamic PersistentVolumes (PVs) must be removed before deleting a cluster]
(https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/83403?lang=en_US&queryTerm=000083403) in the VMware Tanzu Community Knowledge Base.

are also in Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition v1.9.2.
See [Known Issues](#1-9-0-known-issues) in Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition v1.9.0 below.  

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> Do not use <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> with Ops Manager v2.10.15. For more information, see 
<a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/ops-manager/2-10/release-notes.html#2-10-15">v2.10.15</a>

</p>

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.9.2 has the following known issues:

<hr>
#### <a id='1-9-2-compute-profile-az-worker'></a> Your <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Cluster Fails to Start After Changing Your Worker Node's Compute Profile AZ

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.9.3](#1-9-3-features).

**Symptom**

The worker nodes in your <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> cluster fail to start after you modify the AZ in the node's compute profile. 
For example, you may have modified the compute profile AZ for the existing <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> cluster, or 
attached a compute profile configured with an AZ to the existing <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> cluster.  

**Explanation**

In <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.9.2, the AZ for existing worker nodes cannot be changed by modifying their cluster's compute profile.

See also [You Cannot Change a Master Node's AZ](#1-9-0-compute-profile-az-master).

**Workaround**  

Change the AZ for worker nodes in an existing cluster by modifying the cluster's plan.

<hr>
#### <a id='1-9-2-od-broker'></a> <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> CLI `get-credentials` Returns an “od-broker" Error

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.9.5](#1-9-5-features).  
The probability of encountering this issue has been reduced in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.9.4](#1-9-4-features).  

**Symptom**

The <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> CLI `get-credentials` occasionally returns the error "_od-broker is processing a request for the same instance... please try again later_" during periods of intermittent latency.

<hr>
#### <a id="1-9-2-rpc-deadline-exceeded"></a>Pods are Stuck in the Init State and Return the `DeadlineExceeded` RPC Error

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.9.5](#1-9-5-features).  

**Symptom**

You might experience one or more of the following when upgrading to <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.9.2, v1.9.3 or v1.9.4:  

* You are unable to delete Pods.  
* Your Pods are stuck in the Init state.
* `kubelet describe pod` returns the following:

    ```
    Failed to create pod sandbox: rpc error: code = DeadlineExceeded desc = context deadline exceeded
    ```
* Your `kubelet.stderr.log` log includes either of the following errors:

    ```
    Failed to stop sandbox
    ```
    or

    ```
    CNI failed to retrieve network namespace path: cannot find network namespace for the terminated container
    ```  

**Explanation**

A node agent has hung because it was unable to obtain a lock while querying data from cache.  

**Workaround**

To remove this issue, restart the `nsx-node-agent` process:

1. Follow [Retrieve Your Cluster Deployment Names](./bbr-restore.html#cluster-deployment-name) to retrieve the deployment name of your workload cluster.

1. Use `bosh ssh` to access the cluster:

    ```
    bosh ssh -d DEPLOYMENT-NAME worker
    ```
    Where `DEPLOYMENT-NAME` is the workload cluster deployment.

1. Restart `nsx-node-agent` on the cluster's worker node VMs:

    ```
    sudo -i
    monit restart nsx-node-agent
    ```

1. Confirm the `nsx-node-agent` status:

    ```
    watch monit summary
    ```

1. Wait for nsx-node-agent to restart.

### <a id='1-9-0-upgrade'></a>Upgrade Path

The supported upgrade paths to <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.9.0 are from <%= vars.product_short %> v1.8.0 and later.

### <a id="1-9-0-features"></a>Features

This section describes new features and changes in <%= vars.product_full %> v1.9.0.

* **[Security Fix]** Forces all TLS communications with the <%= vars.control_plane_db %> instances to use TLSv1.2+.  
* **[Bug Fix]** NSX-T pre-check errand no longer fails with error "_Unable to check if ESXi hosts are onboarded_".  

#### <a id="1-9-0-windows"></a>Windows Workers on NSX-T

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.9.0 supports clusters with Windows-based worker nodes on vSphere with NSX-T networking only.
<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.9.0 continues to support Windows workloads on vSphere with Flannel networking as a beta feature.

#### <a id="1-9-0-certs"></a>Cluster Certificate Rotation Support

For secure communication, <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> clusters use TLS certificates created unique for each cluster.
<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.9.0 integrates with the [CredHub Maestro](https://docs.pivotal.io/ops-manager/security/pcf-infrastructure/getting-started-with-maestro-cli.html) CLI to enable expiry checks and rotation for these cluster-specific certificates, including additional certificates that clusters use with NSX-T networking.

See [Rotating Cluster Certificates](./rotate-cluster-certificates.html) for how to check and rotate cluster-specific certificates,
and [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Certificates](./certificate-concepts.html) for managing all certificates used by <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>.

#### <a id="1-9-0-certs-local-bundle"></a>PKS CLI Supports Certificates Trusted by the Local System

The PKS CLI now trusts the certificates in a system CA store, such as the MacOS keychain.
If you have a local system CA, you no longer need to specify the `--skip-ssl-validation` or `--ca-cert` command line arguments when logging in to the PKS CLI.

#### <a id="1-9-0-compute-profiles"></a>Compute Profile CLI Support and Improvements (vSphere)

Compute profiles let developers customize cluster topology, node sizing, and other compute resource options, overriding configurations that a cluster inherits from its plan.

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.9.0 redesigns and improves compute profile functionality, and adds TKG CLI options for creating, managing, and using compute profiles.

With NSX-T networking you can use compute profiles with Linux- and Windows-worker clusters.
With Flannel networking you can only apply compute profiles to Linux clusters.

For more information, see [Creating and Managing Compute Profiles with the CLI (vSphere)](./compute-profiles-manage.html).

#### <a id="1-9-0-velero"></a>Velero Support and Bundling for Backup and Restore

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.9.0 includes support for [Velero](https://velero.io/docs), an open source community standard tool for backing up and restoring Kubernetes workloads, including stateless and stateful using persistent volumes.
Velero is the preferred backup solution for workloads running on <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> clusters,
and is downloadable from your <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> downloads page on https://my.vmware.com.

For more information, see [Backing Up and Restoring <%= vars.product_short %>](backup-and-restore.html).

#### <a id="1-9-0-resizable-pv"></a>Resizable Persistent Volume Support on vSphere 7.0

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> supports creating resizable persistent volumes on clusters created on
vSphere 7.0 with CNS v2.0.

For more information, see [Cloud Native Storage (CNS) on vSphere](./vsphere-cns.html).

#### <a id="1-9-0-tagging"></a>Tagging Support on AWS and GCP

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> supports tagging from the CLI on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
This enables the `--tags` option to `tkgi create-cluster` and other commands on all infrastructures.

For more information, see [Tagging Clusters](./tag-clusters.html).

#### <a id="1-9-0-telegraf"></a>New Telegraf Configuration Fields

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> supports modifying the Telegraf Agent configuration.
For more information, see [Configure Telegraf in the Tile](monitor-etcd.html#connect)
in _Configuring Telegraf in <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>_.

#### <a id="1-9-0-telemetry"></a>Telemetry Changes

* **Telemetry Enhanced Participation Level Change**:
The <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Customer Experience Improvement Program (CEIP) and Telemetry Program has been streamlined to bring the Enhanced participation level closer to the Standard participation level.
For descriptions of the participation levels, see [Telemetry](./telemetry.html).

* **Telemetry Database Removal**:
The legacy Telemetry DB has been removed from the <%= vars.control_plane_db %>.

#### <a id="1-9-0-component-updates"></a>Component Updates

#### <a id="1-9-0-old-profile-no-cli"></a><%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.9 Does Not Support Managing Pre-<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.9 Compute Profiles

Compute profiles created in <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.8 and earlier have a different format
from v1.9 compute profiles, as described in [Compute Profile CLI Support and Improvements (vSphere)](#1-9-0-compute-profiles).

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.9 does not support resizing, updating, upgrading, or
managing compute profiles using `tkgi` CLI compute profile commands,
on a cluster that has a compute profile created in <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.8 and earlier.

<hr>
#### <a id="1-9-0-profile-resize-down"></a>TKGI CLI Does Not Prevent Reducing the Control Plane Node Count

TKGI CLI does not prevent accidentally reducing a cluster's control plane node count using a compute profile.

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong>
    Reducing a cluster's control plane node count can destroy the cluster.
    Do not scale out or scale in existing master nodes by reconfiguring the TKGI tile or by using a compute profile.
    Reducing a cluster's number of control plane nodes may remove a master node and cause the cluster to become inactive.
</p>

<hr>
#### <a id="1-9-0-emptydir-volume"></a>Windows Nodes With Workloads and an emptyDir Volume are Unable to Drain

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.9.1](#1-9-1-features).

Node draining will fail when scaling down a Windows cluster with a deployed Windows workload and an emptyDir volume.

**Solution**

Run `kubectl drain NODENAME --delete-local-data`, then restart the cluster scale down.

<hr>
#### <a id="1-9-0-in-cluster-dns-lookup"></a>In-Cluster DNS Lookup Fails in Windows Clusters

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.9.1](#1-9-1-features).

**Symptom**

DNS lookup fails for Windows Pods that do not use a fully qualified domain name (FQDN)
to look up services and Pods within its namespace or cluster.

**Explanation**

DNS lookup fails because a Primary DNS suffix has not been configured on the Windows Pod.
A Windows Pod configured without a Primary DNS suffix must use a fully qualified domain name (FQDN)
to look up addresses within its namespace and cluster.

**Solution**

To configure a Primary DNS suffix for your Windows Pods,
use a hook to dynamically inject a Primary DNS setting into your Windows Pods.
For more information see [In-Cluster DNS lookup requires a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) in Windows Clusters]
(https://community.pivotal.io/s/article/In-Cluster-DNS-Lookup-Requires-a-Fully-Qualified-Domain-Name-in-Windows-Clusters)

<hr>
#### <a id="1-9-0-in-windows-cluster-compute"></a> Windows Cluster Creation Fails for Certain Compute Profile Configurations

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.9.2](#1-9-2-features).

Windows cluster creation does not support using a compute profile with two or more worker instance groups.

<hr>
#### <a id="1-9-0-in-windows-notready-nodes"></a> Windows Cluster Nodes Not Deleted After VM Deleted

**Symptom**

After you delete a VM using the management console of your infrastructure provider, you notice a Windows worker node
that had been on that VM is now in a `notReady` state.

**Solution**

1. To identify the leftover node:

    ```
    kubectl get no -o wide
    ```
1. Locate nodes on the returned list that are in a `notReady` state and have the same IP address as another node in the list.
1. To manually delete a `notReady` node:

    ```
    kubectl delete node NODE-NAME
    ```
    Where `NODE-NAME` is the name of the node in the `notReady` state.

<hr>
#### <a id="1-9-0-oidc-response-header"></a>502 Bad Gateway After OIDC Login

**Symptom**

You experience a "502 Bad Gateway" error from the NSX load balancer after you log in to OIDC.

**Explanation**

A large response header has exceeded your NSX-T load balancer maximum
response header size. The default maximum response header size is 10,240 characters and should
be resized to 50,000.

**Workaround**

If you experience this issue, manually reconfigure your NSX-T `request_header_size`
and `response_header_size` to 50,000 characters.
For information about configuring NSX-T default header sizes,
see [OIDC Response Header Overflow](https://community.pivotal.io/s/article/OIDC-Response-Header-overflow) 
in the VMware Tanzu Community Knowledge Base.

<hr>
#### <a id='1-9-0-windows-proxy'></a> Difficulty Changing Proxy for Windows Workers

You must configure a global proxy in the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile > **Networking** pane before you create any Windows workers that use the proxy.

You cannot change the proxy configuration for Windows workers in an existing cluster.

<hr>
#### <a id='1-9-0-http-proxy-password'></a> Character Limitations in HTTP Proxy Password

For vSphere with NSX-T, the HTTP Proxy password field does not support the following special characters: `&` or `;`.

<hr>
#### <a id='1-9-0-harbor-storage-config'></a> Error After Modifying Your Harbor Storage Configuration

**Symptom**

You receive the following error after modifying your existing Harbor installation's storage configuration:

```
Error response from daemon: manifest for ... not found: manifest unknown: manifest unknown
```

**Explanation**

Harbor does not support modifying an existing Harbor installation's storage configuration.

**Workaround**

To modify your Harbor storage configuration,
re-install Harbor. Before starting Harbor, configure the new Harbor installation with the desired configuration.

<hr>
#### <a id='1-9-0-too-many-open-files'></a> Cluster Creation Fails With Error 'Too Many Open Files'

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.9.2](#1-9-2-features).

**Symptom**

Under certain situations, `tkgi create-cluster` fails with the error `too many open files`:

<pre class="terminal">
$  tkgi create-cluster ... --external-hostname ... --plan small --num-nodes 1

Error: Status: 500; ErrorMessage: &lt;nil&gt;;

The `tkgi create-cluster` command fails with the `too many open files` error
during periods of high latency between the BOSH or <%= vars.control_plane %> servers
and the remainder of the network.

<hr>
#### <a id='1-9-0-401-403'></a> Cluster Creation Fails During the 'Creating Load Balancer' Step

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.9.2](#1-9-2-features).

**Symptom**

Under certain situations, cluster creation occasionally fails with error codes 401 and 403 
during the `Creating Load Balancer` instance provisioning step:

```
"Failed to get node properties" pks-networking=networkManager Error: [GET /node][403] 
readNodePropertiesForbidden  &{RelatedAPIError:{Details: ErrorCode:401 ErrorData:&lt;nil&gt; 
ErrorMessage:Not authorized. ModuleName:common-services} RelatedErrors:[]}
```

<hr>
#### <a id='1-9-0-compute-profile-az-master'></a> You Cannot Change a Master Node's AZ
<%#
This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr 
% > v1.9.4](#1-9-4-features).
%>

**Symptom**

Your existing master nodes return the error:
"_instance group 'master' must specify availability zone that matches availability zones of network_" after you 
modify the node's existing compute profile AZ or after attaching a compute profile configured with an AZ.  

**Explanation**

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> does not support changing an existing master node's AZ, 
either by modifying its cluster plan, modifying its cluster's attached compute profile, or attaching a new compute profile configured with an AZ.

<hr>
#### <a id='1-9-0-cni0-mac-address'></a> Worker Node Kubelet Unable to Communicate with Master Node Kubernetes API after the cni0 Interface Changes Mac Address

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.9.3](#1-9-3-features).

**Symptom**

On Flannel networks, worker node CNI0 interfaces may intermittently change MAC address, 
causing the worker nodes' kubelet to become unable to communicate with the master node Kubernetes API.

**Explanation**

A CNI bridge adopts the lowest MAC address of the attached veths. 
Adding a new container with a veth with a lower MAC address than any of the currently existing AC addresses 
results in changing the MAC address of cbr0, and the deletion of all of the existing connection 
tracking entries for the old MAC address. 
On Flannel networks this results in transient interruption of network traffic with the Pod.

**Workaround**

Complete the steps in [Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated (TKGI) / PKS Disable Docker Bridge]
(https://github.com/svrc/tkgi-disable-docker-bridge) in GitHub.

<hr>
#### <a id='1-9-0-uuid-length'></a> One Plan ID Longer than Other Plan IDs

**Symptom**

One of your plan IDs is one character longer than your other plan IDs.

**Explanation**

In <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>, each plan has a unique plan ID.
A plan ID is normally a UUID consisting of 32 alphanumeric characters and 4 hyphens.
However, the **Plan 4** ID consists of 33 alphanumeric characters and 4 hyphens.

**Solution**

You can safely configure and use **Plan 4**.
The length of the **Plan 4** ID does not affect the functionality of **Plan 4** clusters.

If you require all plan IDs to have identical length, do not activate or use **Plan 4**.

<hr>

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.9.4](#1-9-4-features).

**Symptom**

Installing or upgrading <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> fails with the error:  

```
x509: certificate relies on legacy Common Name field, use SANs or temporarily enable Common Name matching with GODEBUG=x509ignoreCN=0
```

**Explanation**

Your NSX-T Root CA Certificate was generated without a Subject Alternate Name (SAN) and does not work with TKGI. 
For example, if you use VCF, you see this error because VCF generates only NSX-T Root CA Certificates without a SAN. 

<%#
I'm leaving this here in case we decide the instructions in this KB article can be used rather than the steps documented within documentation: 
 - [replace nsx ca cert](https://confluence.eng.vmware.com/display/PKS/replace+nsx+ca+cert)

**Solution**

To complete your installation or upgrade, create a certificate that includes a SAN.

#### <a id='1-9-0-node-pool-resizes-all'></a> Resizing a Compute Profile Node Pool Size May Resize Other Node Pool Sizes

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.9.4](#1-9-4-features).

**Symptom**

If you resize one compute profile node pool in a compute profile containing multiple node pools, the other node pools in the profile may resize.  

**Workaround**

Resize all of the node pools in a compute profile when resizing a single node pool in a compute profile containing multiple node pools.

#### <a id='1-9-0-resizing-worker-nodes'></a> Ingress Controller Statefulset Fails to Start After Resizing Worker Nodes

**Symptom**  

Permissions are removed from your cluster’s files and processes after resizing the persistent disk 
during a cluster upgrade. The ingress controller statefulset fails to start.

**Explanation**  

When resizing a persistent disk, Bosh migrates the data from the old disk to the new disk but 
does not copy the files’ extended attributes.

**Workaround**  

To resolve the problem, complete the steps in 
[Ingress controller statefulset fails to start after resize of worker nodes with permission denied]

#### <a id='1-9-0-az-network-profile'></a> Network Profile Required with Compute Profile

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.9.4](#1-9-4-features).

**Symptom**  

When you create a cluster with a compute profile configured with an AZ setting, 
you must also configure the cluster with a network profile.

<hr>
#### <a id='1-9-0-k8s-race-condition'></a> Kubernetes Worker Nodes Run Out of Space 

**Symptom**

Your Kubernetes worker nodes slowly run out of disk space, 
and your logs indicate Kubernetes has been attempting to access 
a directory that does not exist instead of an actual existing location:  

```
Failed to create existing container: ...: failed to identify the read-write layer ID for container "...". 
- open .../mount-id: no such file or directory
```

**Explanation**

cAdvisor has defaulted to default path settings due to a race condition between kubelet and Docker.

<hr>
#### <a id="1-9-0-security-group"></a>Azure Default Security Group Is Not Automatically Assigned to Cluster VMs

**Symptom**

You experience issues when configuring a load balancer for a multi-master Kubernetes cluster or creating a service of type `LoadBalancer`.
Additionally, in the Azure portal, the **VM** > **Networking** page does not display
any inbound and outbound traffic rules for your cluster VMs.

**Explanation**

As part of configuring the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile for Azure, you enter **Default Security Group** in the **Kubernetes Cloud Provider** pane.
When you create a Kubernetes cluster, <%= vars.product_short %> automatically assigns this security group to each VM in the cluster.
However, on Azure the automatic assignment may not occur.

As a result, your inbound and outbound traffic rules defined in the security group are not applied to the cluster VMs.

**Workaround**

If you experience this issue, manually assign the default security group to each VM NIC in your cluster.

<hr>
#### <a id='1-9-0-uppercase-bosh-dns'></a> FQDNs in <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> API Commands Cannot Contain Uppercase Letters

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.9.5](#1-9-5-features).

**Symptom**

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> CLI commands fail with error:

```
Error: An error occurred in the PKS API when processing
```

**Explanation**

BOSH DNS, which <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> uses for its internal DNS, does not support uppercase letters in FQDNs.

**Workaround**

Use only lowercase letters in FQDNs that you assign to your <%= vars.control_plane %> VM in <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>. 

<%#
<%= vars.control_plane %     > logs include errors like:

```
Caused by: java.net.UnknownHostException: fqdn.example.com: Name or service not known

        at java.base/java.net.InetAddress$PlatformNameService.lookupAllHostAddr(InetAddress.java:929) ~[na:na]
```

The fully-qualified domain names (FQDNs) that you use for vCenter or the <%= vars.control_plane %       > VM contain uppercase letters.

Running `nslookup` from your <%= vars.control_plane %       > VM succeeds with the FQDN with uppercase letters, but fails when you convert them to lowercase.

**Explanation**

BOSH DNS, which <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %     > uses for its internal DNS, does not support uppercase letters in FQDNs.

**Workaround**

Use only lowercase letters in FQDNs that you assign to your vCenter or <%= vars.control_plane %     > VM in <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %     >.

#### <a id='1-9-0-whitespace-pksapi'></a> The <%= vars.control_plane %> FQDN Must Not Include Trailing Whitespace

**Symptom**

Your <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> logs include the following error:

```
'uaa'. Errors are:- Error filling in template 'uaa.yml.erb' (line 59: Client redirect-uri is invalid: uaa.clients.pks_cli.redirect-uri Client redirect-uri is invalid: uaa.clients.pks_cluster_client.redirect-uri)
```

**Explanation**

The <%= vars.control_plane %> fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) for your cluster contains leading or trailing whitespace.  

**Workaround**

Do not include whitespace in the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> tile **API Hostname (FQDN)** field.  

<hr>
#### <a id="1-9-0-bosh-stop-doesnt-drain"></a>Certain Linux Nodes Are Unable to Complete the Drain Process during a TKGI Upgrade

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.9.5](#1-9-5-features).

**Symptom**

You may experience one or more of the following:  

* Your cluster upgrades are interrupted when upgrading the second node of a three-node Pod.  
* Pod eviction fails when either `bosh stop` or `tkgi upgrade-cluster` initiates kubectl drain.

**Explanation**

Ovs drain has finished, removing Pod networking before kubelet has completely drained the Pod. 
Draining a worker node has triggered the removal of a container interface on the node, 
blocking all network traffic from the Pod.

<hr>
#### <a id='1-9-0-do-notuse-resize-cluster'></a> The <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> CLI Resize and Update Cluster Commands Remove the Network Profile CNI Configuration from a Cluster

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.9.5](#1-9-5-features).

**Symptom**

In <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.9.4 or earlier, the network profile CNI configuration is dropped 
when updating the cluster using the `tkgi resize` or `tkgi update-cluster` CLI commands.  

**Solution**

To restore a CNI network profile configuration:  

1. Upgrade <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> to v1.9.5 or later.  
1. Upgrade your <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>-provisioned cluster to <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.9.5 or later.  
1. To restore the network profile CNI configuration to your cluster, modify the cluster using either of the following:
    * The <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> CLI `resize` command:  

        ```
        tkgi resize CLUSTER-NAME
        ```
        Where `CLUSTER-NAME` is the name of your cluster.  
    * The <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> CLI `update-cluster` command:  

        ```
        tkgi update-cluster CLUSTER-NAME --network-profile PROFILE-NAME
        ```
        Where:  
        * `CLUSTER-NAME` is the name of your cluster.
        * `PROFILE-NAME` is the name of the network profile previously applied to the cluster.

#### <a id='1-9-0-import-single-cert'></a> The <%= vars.control_plane %> Does Not Import the Current <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> CA Certificates 

**Symptom**

After rotating your <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> CA certificates, you notice the following:

* When using the <%= vars.control_plane %>, SSL authentication returns the following error and fails:  

    ```
    None of the TrustManagers trust this certificate chain executing POST https://100.104.252.16:8443/oauth/token
    ```
* The keystore file at `/var/vcap/jobs/pks-api/config/cacerts.jks`, contains only a single, stale certificate.

**Explanation** 

The keystore file used by the <%= vars.control_plane %> has not been updated with current CA certificates.

#### <a id='1-9-0-windows-dynamic-pvs'></a> Windows Workloads With Attached Dynamic PVs Must Be Removed before Deleting a Cluster

<%# This issue is fixed in [< % = vars.k8s_runtime_abbr % > v1.9.6](#1-9-6-features). #%>

**Symptom**

Your `tkgi delete-cluster` operation hangs while draining a Windows worker VM
containing a Pod bound to one or more dynamic persistent volumes (PVs).

**Workaround**

Before deleting your Windows cluster, remove all workloads.

<hr>
#### <a id="1-9-0-profile-bosh-upgrade"></a>Compute Profile Dropped From Clusters During BOSH Upgrade

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.9.2](#1-9-2-features).

If a cluster created using a compute profile is upgraded using `tkgi upgrade-cluster`,
the cluster's compute profile is dropped.  

<hr>
#### <a id='1-9-0-fluentbit-clusterlogsink'></a> Fluent Bit ClusterLogSink Returns 'TCP Connection Failed' While CEIP Telemetry Services Are Disabled

**Symptom**  

Fluent Bit ClusterLogSink logs the errors "_TCP connection failed_" and "_no upstream connections available_" 
after you disable CEIP Telemetry services:

```
[2020/10/14 10:38:50] [error] [io] TCP connection failed: telemetry.pks.internal:24224 (Connection timed out)
[2020/10/14 10:38:50] [error] [out_fw] no upstream connections available
[2020/10/14 10:41:08] [error] [io] TCP connection failed: telemetry.pks.internal:24224 (Connection timed out)
[2020/10/14 10:41:08] [error] [out_fw] no upstream connections available
[2020/10/14 10:43:51] [error] [io] TCP connection failed: telemetry.pks.internal:24224 (Connection timed out)

[2020/10/14 10:43:51] [ warn] [engine] Task cannot be retried: task_id=0 thread_id=2 output=forward.0
```

**Explanation** 

Fluent Bit intermittently attempts to connect to the Telemetry Server during ClusterLogSink. 
The connection attempts fail while the CEIP Telemetry services are disabled, 
and Fluent Bit logs the failed connection attempts.  


<hr>
#### <a id='1-9-0-failover-mode'></a> Network Profiles Does Not Support the `failover_mode` Parameter

**Symptom**

When you attempt to resize or update a cluster, the operation fails with logged errors similar to the following:  

```
Error processing update parameters: Unexpected field 'failover_mode'
```

**Explanation** 

The `failover_mode` network profile parameter has been incorrectly flagged as an unsupported parameter.  

**Workaround**  

To remove the `failover_mode` parameter from a network profile:  

1. Create a copy of the network profile configuration file used by your cluster.  
1. Remove the `failover_mode` parameter from the copy of the configuration file. 
For example, remove:  

    ```
    "failover_mode":"PREEMPTIVE",
    ```
1. Update the network profile for the cluster using the revised configuration file.  

You can now resize your cluster.  

<hr>
#### <a id='1-9-0-ncp-not-in-vrli'></a> You Cannot Use vRealize Log Insight (vRLI) to Monitor NCP

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.9.6](#1-9-6-features).

**Symptom**  

vRLI monitoring does not include NCP stdout or stderror.  

**Explanation** 

A bug in the vRLI configuration prevents inclusion of NCP stdout and stderror in vRLI.

**Workaround**

To write NCP logs for a cluster to vRLI:  

1. Confirm you have admin access to the master node.
1. Open `/var/vcap/jobs/fluentd/config/config.d/nsx-t.conf`.
1. Replace:  

    ```
    expression /^(?<num>[\w]+) (?<time>[^ ]+) (?<nsx_uuid>[^ ]+) (?<nsx_component>[^ ]+) (?<pid>[^ ]+) - \[.* level="(?<severity>[^\"]+)".*\] (?<message>.+)/
    ```

    with: 

    ```
    expression /^(?<time>[^ ]+) (?<nsx_uuid>[^ ]+) (?<nsx_component>[^ ]+) (?<pid>[^ ]+) - \[.* level="(?<severity>[^\"]+)".*\] (?<message>.+)/

#### <a id='1-9-0-eight-size-error'></a> NSX-T Pre-Check Errand Fails Due to Edge Node CPU Memory Configuration

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.9.6](#1-9-6-features).

**Symptom**

You have configured your NSX-T Edge Node VM as `medium` size,
and the NSX-T Pre-Check Errand fails with the following error:
"_ERROR: NSX-T Precheck failed due to Edge Node ... memory is less than 8GB_".

**Explanation**

The NSX-T Pre-Check Errand has failed because the NSX-T Edge Node has less than 8GB of available memory.

<hr>
#### <a id='1-9-0-eight-cores-error'></a> NSX-T Pre-Check Errand Fails Due to Edge Node CPU Count Configuration

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.8.0](https://docs.pivotal.io/tkgi/1-8/release-notes.html#1-8-0-features) and later 
and was incorrectly included in the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.9 Release Notes.

**Symptom**

You have configured your NSX-T Edge Node VM as `medium` size,
and the NSX-T Pre-Check Errand fails with the following error:
"_ERROR: NSX-T Precheck failed due to Edge Node ... no of cpu cores is less than 8_".

**Explanation**

The NSX-T Pre-Check Errand is erroneously returning the "_cpu cores is less than 8_" error.

**Solution**

You can safely configure your NSX-T Edge Node VMs as `medium` size and ignore the error.  

<hr>
#### <a id='1-9-0-ncp-port-protocol-limit'></a> Cluster Fails to Restart

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.9.6](#1-9-6-features).  

**Symptom**  

A stopped cluster fails to restart and you see the following error in the NSX Container Plug-in (NCP) logs:

```
Response body {'httpStatus': 'BAD_REQUEST', 'module_name': 'nsx-search', 'error_code': 60513, 'error_message': 'The result set is too large. Please refine the search criteria.'}
```

**Explanation** 

This problem occurs on clusters with a network policy with more than twelve port-protocol fields.

**Workaround**

Modify the cluster network policy to have twelve or fewer port-protocol fields.  


<hr>
#### <a id='1-9-0-fluentd-log-overflow'></a> The <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> API VM fluentd.stdout.log Grows While vRealize Log Insight is Disabled

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.9.6](#1-9-6-features).  

**Symptom**  

While vRealize Log Insight (vRLI) is disabled, the log for `fluentd.stdout` on the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> API VM
grows quite large and rolls over frequently.  

**Explanation** 

The fluentd job on the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> API VM automatically starts when vRLI is disabled. 
This fluentd job runs continuously, frequently writing inaccessible hostname errors to stdout 
for the non-existent vRLI endpoint. 
The fluentd stdout on the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> API VM is logged in: 
`/var/vcap/sys/log/pks-vrli-control-plane-fluentd/fluentd.stdout.log`.  


<hr>
#### <a id="1-9-0-renamed-ops-man"></a> TKGI MC Unable to Manage TKGI after Restoring the TKGI Control Plane from Backup

**Symptom**

After you restore Ops Manager and the <%= vars.control_plane %> VM from backup, <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> functions normally, 
but your <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> MC tabs include the following error: “…product ‘pivotal-container service’ is not deployed…”. 

**Explanation**

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> MC is associated with an Ops Manager with a specific name. 
If you rename Ops Manager with a new name while restoring, 
your <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> MC will not recognize the restored Ops Manager and cannot manage it.  

<hr>
#### <a id="1-9-0-all-saml-are-signed"></a> SAML Authentication Requests Are Always Signed

**Symptom**

After you disable the SAML Identity Provider **Sign Authentication Requests** setting on the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile, 
SAML IdP authentication requests continue to be signed.   

<hr>
#### <a id="1-9-0-errors-after-reinstall"></a> BOSH Director Logs the Error 'Duplicate vm extension name'

**Symptom**

After you uninstall <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>, then reinstall <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> in the same environment, 
BOSH Director logs errors similar to the following:  

```
.../gems/bosh-director-0.0.0/lib/bosh/director/deployment_plan/cloud_manifest_parser.rb:120:in `parse_vm_extensions': Duplicate vm extension name 'disk_enable_uuid' (Bosh::Director::DeploymentDuplicateVmExtensionName)
```

**Explanation**

The `pivotal-container-service` cloud-config was not removed when you uninstalled the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> tile, 
and it remained active.
When you reinstalled the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> tile, an additional `pivotal-container-service` cloud-config was created, 
causing the metrics_server to fall into a crash-loop state.  

**Workaround**

You must manually remove the `pivotal-container-service` cloud-config after removing your <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> deployment, 
including after removing the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> tile from Ops Manager.  

For more information, see ["Duplicate vm extension name" 
error when metrics_server runs on Director VM in Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition]

<hr>
#### <a id="1-9-0-azure-hostnames-not-resolved"></a> Node Hostnames Are Not Resolved for BYO DNS in Azure Environments

**Symptom**

If you use a bring-your-own DNS configuration in Azure environments, 
node hostnames are not resolved on your <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> clusters, and kubectl returns a "no such host" error:

```
Error from server: Get "...": dial tcp: lookup ... on ... no such host
```

**Explanation**

On Azure, the Azure CPI uses BOSH `agent_id` GUIDs as the VM name. 
Additionally, the Azure Kubernetes cloud provider mandates the VM name matches the hostname 
and that the hostname is resolvable without using search domains.

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> on Azure relies on Dynamic DNS updates via DHCP to allow resolvable K8s node names. 
Environments with a bring-your-own DNS server configuration must provide an alternative method 
for updating DNS entries.

#### <a id="management-console-1-9-0-vrli-https"></a> vRealize Log Insight Integration Does Not Support HTTPS Connections

**Symptom**

The <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console integration to vRealize Log Insight does not support connections to the HTTPS port on the vRealize Log Insight server.

**Workaround**

1. Use SSH to log in to the <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console appliance VM.
1. Open the file `/lib/systemd/system/pks-loginsight.service` in a text editor.
1. Add `-e LOG_SERVER_ENABLE_SSL_VERIFY=false`.
1. Set `-e LOG_SERVER_USE_SSL=true`.

    The resulting file should look like the following example:

    ```
    ExecStart=/bin/docker run --privileged --restart=always --network=pks
    -v /var/log/journal:/var/log/journal
    --name=pks-loginsight
    -e TYPE=gear2-vm
    -e LOG_SERVER_HOST=${LOGINSIGHT_HOST}
    -e LOG_SERVER_PORT=${LOGINSIGHT_PORT}
    -e LOG_SERVER_ENABLE_SSL_VERIFY=false
    -e LOG_SERVER_USE_SSL=true
    -e LOG_SERVER_AGENT_ID=${LOGINSIGHT_ID}
    pksoctopus/vrli-journald:v07092019
    ```

1. Save the file and run `systemctl daemon-reload`.
1. To restart the vRealize Log Insight service, run `systemctl restart pks-loginsight.service`.

<%= vars.product_short %> Management Console can now send logs to the HTTPS port on the vRealize Log Insight server.

#### <a id="management-console-1-9-0-vsphere-ha"></a> vSphere HA causes Management Console ovfenv Data Corruption

**Symptom**

If you enable vSphere HA on a cluster, if the TKGI Management Console appliance VM is running on a host in that cluster, and if the host reboots, vSphere HA recreates a new TKGI Management Console appliance VM on another host in the cluster. Due to an issue with vSphere HA, the `ovfenv` data for the newly created appliance VM is corrupted and the new appliance VM does not boot up with the correct network configuration.

**Workaround**

- In the vSphere Client, right-click the appliance VM and select **Power** > **Shut Down Guest OS**.
- Right-click the appliance again and select Edit Settings.
- Select **VM Options** and click **OK**.
- Verify under Recent Tasks that a `Reconfigure virtual machine` task has run on the appliance VM.
- Power on the appliance VM.
