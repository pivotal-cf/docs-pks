#### <a id="1-12-0-nsxt-302-310"></a> Pods Stop After Upgrading From NSX-T v3.0.2 to v3.1.0 on vSphere 7.0 and 7.0.1

**Symptom**

Your TKGI-provisioned Pods stop after upgrading from NSX-T v3.0.2 to NSX-T v3.1.0 on vSphere 7.0 and 7.0.1.

**Explanation**

For information, see [Issue 2603550: Some VMs are vMotioned and lose network connectivity during UA nodes upgrade]
(https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center/3.1/rn/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center-311-Release-Notes.html#2603550) in the _VMware NSX-T Data Center 3.1.1 Release Notes_.

**Workaround**

To avoid the loss of network connectivity during UA node upgrade, ensure DRS is set to manual mode during your upgrade from NSX-T v3.0.2 to v3.1.0.

If you upgraded to NSX-T v3.1.0 with DRS in automation mode, run the following on the affected Pods' master VMs to restore Pod connectivity:

```
monit restart ncp
```

#### <a id="1-12-0-in-windows-notready-nodes"></a> Windows Cluster Nodes Not Deleted After VM Deleted

**Symptom**

After you delete a VM using the management console of your infrastructure provider, you notice a Windows worker node
that had been on that VM is now in a `notReady` state.

**Solution**

1. To identify the leftover node:

    ```
    kubectl get no -o wide
    ```
1. Locate nodes on the returned list that are in a `notReady` state and have the same IP address as another node in the list.
1. To manually delete a `notReady` node:

    ```
    kubectl delete node NODE-NAME
    ```
    Where `NODE-NAME` is the name of the node in the `notReady` state.

<hr>
#### <a id="1-12-0-oidc-response-header"></a>502 Bad Gateway After OIDC Login

**Symptom**

You experience a "502 Bad Gateway" error from the NSX load balancer after you log in to OIDC.

**Explanation**

A large response header has exceeded your NSX-T load balancer maximum
response header size. The default maximum response header size is 10,240 characters and should
be resized to 50,000.

**Workaround**

If you experience this issue, manually reconfigure your NSX-T `request_header_size`
and `response_header_size` to 50,000 characters.
For information about configuring NSX-T default header sizes,
see [OIDC Response Header Overflow](https://community.pivotal.io/s/article/OIDC-Response-Header-overflow) in the Knowledge Base.

<hr>
#### <a id="1-12-0-windows-proxy"></a> Difficulty Changing Proxy for Windows Workers

You must configure a global proxy in the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile > **Networking** pane before you create any Windows workers that use the proxy.

You cannot change the proxy configuration for Windows workers in an existing cluster.

<hr>
#### <a id="1-12-0-http-proxy-password"></a> Character Limitations in HTTP Proxy Password

For vSphere with NSX-T, the HTTP Proxy password field does not support the following special characters: `&` or `;`.

<hr>
#### <a id="1-12-0-harbor-storage-config"></a> Error After Modifying Your Harbor Storage Configuration

**Symptom**

You receive the following error after modifying your existing Harbor installation's storage configuration:

```
Error response from daemon: manifest for ... not found: manifest unknown: manifest unknown
```

**Explanation**

Harbor does not support modifying an existing Harbor installation's storage configuration.

**Workaround**

To modify your Harbor storage configuration,
re-install Harbor. Before starting Harbor, configure the new Harbor installation with the desired configuration.

<hr>
#### <a id="1-12-0-resizing-worker-nodes"></a> Ingress Controller Statefulset Fails to Start After Resizing Worker Nodes

**Symptom**  

Permissions are removed from your cluster’s files and processes after resizing the persistent disk 
during a cluster upgrade. The ingress controller statefulset fails to start.

**Explanation**  

When resizing a persistent disk, Bosh migrates the data from the old disk to the new disk but 
does not copy the files’ extended attributes.

**Workaround**  

To resolve the problem, complete the steps in 
[Ingress controller statefulset fails to start after resize of worker nodes with permission denied]
(https://community.pivotal.io/s/article/5000e00001nCJxT1603094435795?language=en_US)
in the VMware Tanzu Knowledge Base.

<hr>
#### <a id="1-12-0-security-group"></a>Azure Default Security Group Is Not Automatically Assigned to Cluster VMs

**Symptom**

You experience issues when configuring a load balancer for a multi-master Kubernetes cluster or creating a service of type `LoadBalancer`.
Additionally, in the Azure portal, the **VM** > **Networking** page does not display
any inbound and outbound traffic rules for your cluster VMs.

**Explanation**

As part of configuring the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile for Azure, you enter **Default Security Group** in the **Kubernetes Cloud Provider** pane.
When you create a Kubernetes cluster, <%= vars.product_short %> automatically assigns this security group to each VM in the cluster.
However, on Azure the automatic assignment may not occur.

As a result, your inbound and outbound traffic rules defined in the security group are not applied to the cluster VMs.

**Workaround**

If you experience this issue, manually assign the default security group to each VM NIC in your cluster.

<hr>
#### <a id="1-12-0-uuid-length"></a> One Plan ID Longer than Other Plan IDs

**Symptom**

One of your plan IDs is one character longer than your other plan IDs.

**Explanation**

In <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>, each plan has a unique plan ID.
A plan ID is normally a UUID consisting of 32 alphanumeric characters and 4 hyphens.
However, the **Plan 4** ID consists of 33 alphanumeric characters and 4 hyphens.

**Solution**

You can safely configure and use **Plan 4**.
The length of the **Plan 4** ID does not affect the functionality of **Plan 4** clusters.

If you require all plan IDs to have identical length, do not activate or use **Plan 4**.

<hr>
#### <a id="1-12-0-db-down-after-vm-stopped"></a> Database Cluster Stops After a Database Instance is Stopped

**Symptom**

After you stop one instance in a multiple-instance database cluster, the cluster stops,
or communication between the remaining databases times out, and the entire cluster becomes unreachable.

The following might be in your UAA log:

```
WSREP has not yet prepared node for application use
```

**Explanation**

The database cluster is unable to recover automatically because a member is no longer available to reconcile quorum. 

<hr>
#### <a id="1-12-0-velero-vsphere-pvs"></a> Velero Back Up Fails for vSphere PVs Attached to Clusters on Kubernetes v1.20 and Later

**Symptom**  

Backing up vSphere persistent volumes using Velero fails and your Velero backup log includes the following error:

```
rpc error: code = Unknown desc = Failed during IsObjectBlocked check: Could not translate selfLink to CRD name
```

**Explanation** 

This is a known issue when backing up clusters on Kubernetes v1.20 and later using the 
Velero Plugin for vSphere v1.1.0 or earlier.  

**Workaround**  

To resolve the problem, complete the steps in 
[Velero backups of vSphere persistent volumes fail on Kubernetes clusters version 1.20 or higher (83314)](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/83314) 
in the VMware Tanzu Knowledge Base.   

<hr>
#### <a id="1-12-0-creating-two-windows-clusters-fails"></a> Creating Two Windows Clusters at the Same Time Fails

**Symptom**

The first time that you try to create two Windows clusters at the same time, the creation of one of
the clusters fails. If you run `pks cluster CLUSTER-NAME` to examine the last action taken on the
cluster, you see the following:

<pre class="terminal">
Last Action: Create
Last Action State: failed
Last Action Description: Instance provisioning failed: There was a problem completing your request.
. . .
operation: create, error-message: Failed to acquire lock
. . .

**Explanation**

This is a known issue that occurs the first time that you create two Windows clusters concurrently.

**Workaround**

Recreate the failed cluster. This issue only occurs the first time that you create two Windows
clusters concurrently.  


<hr>
#### <a id="1-12-0-delete-cluster-not-stopped"></a> Deleted Clusters are Listed in Cluster Lists

**Symptom**

After running `tkgi delete-cluster` and cluster deletion has completed, 
the deleted cluster continues to be listed when running `tkgi clusters`.

**Workaround**

You must manually remove the deleted cluster using a customized version of the ncp_cleanup script. 
For more information, see 
[Deleting a Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition cluster with "tkgi delete-cluster" stuck "in progress" status](https://community.pivotal.io/s/article/pks-delete-cluster-in-progress-after-the-cluster-has-been-deleted?language=en_US) 
in the VMware Tanzu Knowledge Base.


<hr>
#### <a id="1-12-0-create-cluster-ip-already-allocated"></a> Creating a New Cluster Fails With the Error 'IP Is Already Allocated'

**Symptom**

Creating a new cluster fails while using the Antrea CNI. The coreDNS add-on errand logs an error similar to the following:

```
The Service \"kube-dns\" is invalid: spec.clusterIPs: Invalid value: []string{\"10.100.200.2\"}: failed to allocated ip:10.100.200.2 with error:provided IP is already allocated\n"
```

**Workaround**

Delete the failed cluster and run `tkgi create-cluster` again.

<hr>
#### <a id="1-12-0-errors-after-reinstall"></a> BOSH Director Logs the Error 'Duplicate vm extension name'

**Symptom**

After you uninstall <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>, then reinstall <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> in the same environment, 
BOSH Director logs errors similar to the following:  

```
.../gems/bosh-director-0.0.0/lib/bosh/director/deployment_plan/cloud_manifest_parser.rb:120:in `parse_vm_extensions': Duplicate vm extension name 'disk_enable_uuid' (Bosh::Director::DeploymentDuplicateVmExtensionName)
```

**Explanation**

The `pivotal-container-service` cloud-config was not removed when you uninstalled the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> tile, 
and it remained active.
When you reinstalled the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> tile, an additional `pivotal-container-service` cloud-config was created, 
causing the metrics_server to fall into a crash-loop state.  

**Workaround**

You must manually remove the `pivotal-container-service` cloud-config after removing your <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> deployment, 
including after removing the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> tile from Ops Manager.  

For more information, see ["Duplicate vm extension name" 
error when metrics_server runs on Director VM in Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition]

```

**Explanation**

The <%= vars.control_plane %> fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) for your cluster contains leading or trailing whitespace.

**Workaround**

Do not include whitespace in the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> tile **API Hostname (FQDN)** field.

The <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console integration to vRealize Log Insight does not support connections to the HTTPS port on the vRealize Log Insight server.

**Workaround**

1. Use SSH to log in to the <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console appliance VM.
1. Open the file `/lib/systemd/system/pks-loginsight.service` in a text editor.
1. Add `-e LOG_SERVER_ENABLE_SSL_VERIFY=false`.
1. Set `-e LOG_SERVER_USE_SSL=true`.

    The resulting file should look like the following example:

    ```
    ExecStart=/bin/docker run --privileged --restart=always --network=pks
    -v /var/log/journal:/var/log/journal
    --name=pks-loginsight
    -e TYPE=gear2-vm
    -e LOG_SERVER_HOST=${LOGINSIGHT_HOST}
    -e LOG_SERVER_PORT=${LOGINSIGHT_PORT}
    -e LOG_SERVER_ENABLE_SSL_VERIFY=false
    -e LOG_SERVER_USE_SSL=true
    -e LOG_SERVER_AGENT_ID=${LOGINSIGHT_ID}
    pksoctopus/vrli-journald:v07092019
    ```

1. Save the file and run `systemctl daemon-reload`.
1. To restart the vRealize Log Insight service, run `systemctl restart pks-loginsight.service`.

<%= vars.product_short %> Management Console can now send logs to the HTTPS port on the vRealize Log Insight server.

#### <a id="management-console-1-12-0-vsphere-ha"></a> vSphere HA causes Management Console ovfenv Data Corruption

**Symptom**

If you enable vSphere HA on a cluster, if the TKGI Management Console appliance VM is running on a host in that cluster, and if the host reboots, vSphere HA recreates a new TKGI Management Console appliance VM on another host in the cluster. Due to an issue with vSphere HA, the `ovfenv` data for the newly created appliance VM is corrupted and the new appliance VM does not boot up with the correct network configuration.

**Workaround**

- In the vSphere Client, right-click the appliance VM and select **Power** > **Shut Down Guest OS**.
- Right-click the appliance again and select Edit Settings.
- Select **VM Options** and click **OK**.
- Verify under Recent Tasks that a `Reconfigure virtual machine` task has run on the appliance VM.
- Power on the appliance VM.

#### <a id="management-console-1-12-0-k8s-profile"></a> Base64 encoded file arguments are not decoded in Kubernetes profiles

**Symptom**

Some file arguments in Kubernetes profiles are base64 encoded. When the management console displays the Kubernetes profile,
some file arguments are not decoded.

**Workaround**

Run `echo "$content" | base64 --decode`

#### <a id="management-console-1-12-0-network-profile"></a> Network profiles not immediately selectable

**Symptom**

If you create network profiles and then try to apply them in the Create Cluster page, the new profiles
are not available for selection.

**Workaround**

Log out of the management console and log back in again.

#### <a id="management-console-1-12-0-cluster-summary"></a> Real-Time IP information not displayed for network profiles

**Symptom**

In the cluster summary page, only default IP pool, pod IP block, node IP block values are displayed,
rather than the real-time values from the associated network profile.

**Workaround**

None

#### <a id="management-console-1-12-0-cluster-group-name"></a> Your New Clusters Are Not Shown In Tanzu Mission Control

**Symptom**

After you create a cluster, Tanzu Mission Control does not include the cluster in cluster lists. 
You have a "_Resource not found_" error similar to the following in your BOSH logs:

```
Cluster Name in TMC: cluster-1
Cluster Name Prefix: tkgi-my-prefix-
Group Name in TMC: my-prefix-clusters
Cluster Description in TMC: VMware Enterprise PKS Attaching cluster ''tkgi-my-prefix-cluster-1'' to TMC 
Fetching token successful 
request POST:/v1alpha1/clusters, 
response 404 Not Found:{"error":"Resource not found - clustergroup(my-prefix-clusters) 
org id(d859dc9f-g622-426d-8c91-939a9f13dea9)",
"code":5,"message":"Resource not found - clustergroup(my-prefix-clusters)
```

**Explanation**

The cluster group you assign a cluster to must be defined in Tanzu Mission Control 
before you assign your cluster to the cluster group in the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Management Console.

**Workaround**  

To resolve the problem, complete the steps in 
[Attaching a Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated (TKGI) cluster to Tanzu Mission Control (TMC) fails with "Resource not found - clustergroup(cluster-group-name)"](https://community.pivotal.io/s/article/tkgi-tmc-attach-fail) 
in the VMware Tanzu Knowledge Base.
