<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.14.1 has the following known issue:

<hr>

#### <a id="1-14-1-windows-cluster-upgrade"></a> Upgrade of Windows cluster that has containerd as the container runtime can fail

**Symptom**

Cluster upgrade for a Windows cluster can fail:

* If the Windows cluster has containerd as the container runtime.
* When you attempt to switch the container runtime from containerd to Docker during the cluster upgrade.

**Explanation**

The Windows cluster upgrade can fail with the following error message:

```
Error: Action Failed get_task: Task 472b18b9-484f-4323-77ed-fcabf7f51eae result: Applying: Keeping only needed packages: Uninstalling package bundle: remove /var/vcap/data/packages/containerd-windows/9beecbdcbcbc016def57e61f4914847998868a0d\containerd\containerd-shim-runhcs-v1.exe: Access is denied.
```

**Workaround**

Manually remove the VMs that have the issue. BOSH recreates the removed VMs automatically after a few minutes.

&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; To use Policy API features, you must use NSX-T v3.1.3 or later.  


### <a id='1-14-0-upgrade'></a>Upgrade Path

The supported upgrade paths to <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.14.0 are from <%= vars.product_short %> v1.13.2, v1.13.1, and v1.13.0.

### <a id="1-14-0-breaking-changes"></a>Breaking Changes

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.14.0 has the following breaking changes:

* Linux and Windows cluster container runtimes are automatically switched from Docker to containerd during the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.14.0 upgrade.
    <p class="note warning"><strong>Warning</strong>: The upgrade to <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.14.0 will switch a "locked" cluster to using the containerd runtime
    if, between locking the container runtime and upgrading, you ran <code>tkgi update-cluster</code> without including the <code>lock_container_runtime: true</code> parameter in your configuration.
    For more information on locking the container runtime, see
    <a href="checklist.html#upgrade-runtime">Customize Cluster Container Runtimes Before Upgrading</a>
    in <i>Upgrade Preparation Checklist for <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %></i>.
    </p>
* Docker commands on worker VMs' no longer work:
    Clusters using the Docker container runtime no longer default to supporting Docker command line commands.
    For more information, see [Docker Commands No Longer Work on Worker VMs](#1-14-0-docker-commands-disabled) below.
* Kubernetes has been upgraded to Kubernetes v1.23.4:
    * The CSI Migration feature is enabled by default in Kubernetes v1.23 but is not enabled by default in <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> 1.14.
    This allows administrators to control the timing of their migration from an existing in-tree storage driver.
    The CSI Migration feature remains in Beta for Google Compute Engine (GCE) PD, Amazon Web Services (AWS) EBS, and Azure Disk.
    * The PodSecurityPolicy admission controller has been deprecated and replaced with PodSecurity, which is now in Beta.
    The PodSecurity feature gate is now enabled by default.

    For more information about Kubernetes v1.23, see
    [Kubernetes 1.23: The Next Frontier](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2021/12/07/kubernetes-1-23-release-announcement/)
    in the Kubernetes documentation.
* Support for the manually installed vSphere CSI Driver has been entirely removed.
    <p class="note warning"><strong>Warning</strong>: Before upgrading to <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.14,
        you must prepare your clusters for removing the manually installed vSphere CSI Driver.
        For information on how to migrate to automatic vSphere CSI Driver installation, see
        <a href="vsphere-cns.html#uninstall-csi">Switch From the Manually Installed vSphere CSI Driver to the Automatic CSI Driver</a>
       in <i>Deploying and Managing Cloud Native Storage (CNS) on vSphere</i>.
    </p>

* The kube-apiserver `audit.log` file is in a new location:
    * Location in <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.13.4 and earlier: `/var/vcap/sys/log/kube-apiserver/audit.log`
    * Location in <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.14.0 and later: `/var/vcap/sys/log/kube-apiserver/audit/log/audit.log`

###<a id='1-14-0-known-issues'></a>Known Issues

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.14.0 has the following known issues.


<hr>

#### <a id="1-14-0-renamed-ops-man"></a> TKGI MC Unable to Manage TKGI after Restoring the TKGI Control Plane from Backup

**Symptom**

After you restore Ops Manager and the <%= vars.control_plane %> VM from backup,
<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> functions normally, but your <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> MC tabs
include the following error: "...product 'pivotal-container service' is not deployed...".

**Explanation**

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> MC is associated with an Ops Manager with a specific name.
If you rename Ops Manager with a new name while restoring, your <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> MC
will not recognize the restored Ops Manager and cannot manage it.

<hr>

#### <a id="1-14-0-hyperbus-error"></a> Kubernetes Pods on NSX-T Become Stuck in a Creating State

**Symptom**

The pods in your <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Kubernetes clusters on NSX-T become stuck in a
creating state.
The connections between nsx-node-agent and hyperbus repeatedly close, log
`Couldn't connect to 'tcp://...' (error: 111-Connection refused)`, and have a status of
`COMMUNICATION_ERROR`.

**Explanation**

For information and workaround steps for this Known Issue, see
[Issue 2795268: Connection between nsx-node-agent and hyperbus flips and Kubernetes pod is stuck at creating state](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center/3.1/rn/NSX-Container-Plugin-312-Release-Notes.html#RNA_11559)
in _NSX Container Plugin 3.1.2 Release Notes_ in the VMware documentation.



<hr>

#### <a id="1-14-0-azure-apply-changes"></a> Error: Could Not Execute "Apply-Changes" in Azure Environment

**Symptom**

After clicking **Apply Changes** on the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> tile in an Azure environment,
you experience an error '_...could not execute "apply-changes"..._' with either of the following descriptions:

* _{"errors":{"base":["undefined method 'location' for nil:NilClass"]}}_
* _FailedError.new("Resource Groups in region '#{location}' do not support Availability Zones"))_

For example:

```

**Explanation**

The Azure CPI endpoint used by Ops Manager has been changed and
your installed version of Ops Manager is not compatible with the new endpoint.

**Workaround**

Run the following Ops Manager CLI command:

```
om --skip-ssl-validation --username USERNAME --password PASSWORD --target https://OPSMAN-API curl --silent --path /api/v0/staged/director/verifiers/install_time/IaasConfigurationVerifier -x PUT -d '{ "enabled": false }'
```

Where:

* `USERNAME` is the account to use to run Ops Manager API commands.
* `PASSWORD` is the password for the account.
* `OPSMAN-API` is the IP address for the Ops Manager API

</p>

<hr>

#### <a id="1-14-0-in-windows-notready-nodes"></a> Windows Cluster Nodes Not Deleted After VM Deleted

**Symptom**

After you delete a VM using the management console of your infrastructure provider, you notice a Windows worker node
that had been on that VM is now in a `notReady` state.

**Solution**

1. To identify the leftover node:

    ```
    kubectl get no -o wide
    ```
1. Locate nodes on the returned list that are in a `notReady` state and have the same IP address as another node in the list.
1. To manually delete a `notReady` node:

    ```
    kubectl delete node NODE-NAME
    ```
    Where `NODE-NAME` is the name of the node in the `notReady` state.

<hr>

#### <a id="1-14-0-oidc-response-header"></a>502 Bad Gateway After OIDC Login

**Symptom**

You experience a "502 Bad Gateway" error from the NSX load balancer after you log in to OIDC.

**Explanation**

A large response header has exceeded your NSX-T load balancer maximum
response header size. The default maximum response header size is 10,240 characters and should
be resized to 50,000.

**Workaround**

If you experience this issue, manually reconfigure your NSX-T `request_header_size`
and `response_header_size` to 50,000 characters.
For information about configuring NSX-T default header sizes,
see [OIDC Response Header Overflow](https://community.pivotal.io/s/article/OIDC-Response-Header-overflow) in the Knowledge Base.

<hr>

#### <a id="1-14-0-windows-proxy"></a> Difficulty Changing Proxy for Windows Workers

You must configure a global proxy in the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile > **Networking** pane before you create any Windows workers that use the proxy.

You cannot change the proxy configuration for Windows workers in an existing cluster.

<hr>

#### <a id="1-14-0-http-proxy-password"></a> Character Limitations in HTTP Proxy Password

For vSphere with NSX-T, the HTTP Proxy password field does not support the following special characters: `&` or `;`.

<hr>

#### <a id="1-14-0-harbor-storage-config"></a> Error After Modifying Your Harbor Storage Configuration

**Symptom**

You receive the following error after modifying your existing Harbor installation's storage configuration:

```
Error response from daemon: manifest for ... not found: manifest unknown: manifest unknown
```

**Explanation**

Harbor does not support modifying an existing Harbor installation's storage configuration.

**Workaround**

To modify your Harbor storage configuration,
re-install Harbor. Before starting Harbor, configure the new Harbor installation with the desired configuration.

<hr>

#### <a id="1-14-0-resizing-worker-nodes"></a> Ingress Controller Statefulset Fails to Start After Resizing Worker Nodes

**Symptom**

Permissions are removed from your cluster's files and processes after resizing the persistent disk
during a cluster upgrade. The ingress controller statefulset fails to start.

**Explanation**

When resizing a persistent disk, Bosh migrates the data from the old disk to the new disk but
does not copy the files' extended attributes.

**Workaround**

To resolve the problem, complete the steps in
[Ingress controller statefulset fails to start after resize of worker nodes with permission denied]
(https://community.pivotal.io/s/article/5000e00001nCJxT1603094435795?language=en_US)
in the VMware Tanzu Knowledge Base.

<hr>

#### <a id="1-14-0-security-group"></a>Azure Default Security Group Is Not Automatically Assigned to Cluster VMs

**Symptom**

You experience issues when configuring a load balancer for a multi-control plane node Kubernetes cluster or creating a service of type `LoadBalancer`.
Additionally, in the Azure portal, the **VM** > **Networking** page does not display
any inbound and outbound traffic rules for your cluster VMs.

**Explanation**

As part of configuring the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile for Azure, you enter **Default Security Group** in the **Kubernetes Cloud Provider** pane.
When you create a Kubernetes cluster, <%= vars.product_short %> automatically assigns this security group to each VM in the cluster.
However, on Azure the automatic assignment may not occur.

As a result, your inbound and outbound traffic rules defined in the security group are not applied to the cluster VMs.

**Workaround**

If you experience this issue, manually assign the default security group to each VM NIC in your cluster.

<hr>

#### <a id="1-14-0-uuid-length"></a> One Plan ID Longer than Other Plan IDs

**Symptom**

One of your plan IDs is one character longer than your other plan IDs.

**Explanation**

In <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>, each plan has a unique plan ID.
A plan ID is normally a UUID consisting of 32 alphanumeric characters and 4 hyphens.
However, the **Plan 4** ID consists of 33 alphanumeric characters and 4 hyphens.

**Solution**

You can safely configure and use **Plan 4**.
The length of the **Plan 4** ID does not affect the functionality of **Plan 4** clusters.

If you require all plan IDs to have identical length, do not activate or use **Plan 4**.

<hr>

#### <a id="1-14-0-db-down-after-vm-stopped"></a> Database Cluster Stops After a Database Instance is Stopped

**Symptom**

After you stop one instance in a multiple-instance database cluster, the cluster stops,
or communication between the remaining databases times out, and the entire cluster becomes unreachable.

The following might be in your UAA log:

```
WSREP has not yet prepared node for application use
```

**Explanation**

The database cluster is unable to recover automatically because a member is no longer available to reconcile quorum.

<hr>

#### <a id="1-14-0-velero-vsphere-pvs"></a> Velero Back Up Fails for vSphere PVs Attached to Clusters on Kubernetes v1.20 and Later

**Symptom**

Backing up vSphere persistent volumes using Velero fails and your Velero backup log includes the following error:

```
rpc error: code = Unknown desc = Failed during IsObjectBlocked check: Could not translate selfLink to CRD name
```

**Explanation**

This is a known issue when backing up clusters on Kubernetes v1.20 and later using the
Velero Plugin for vSphere v1.1.0 or earlier.

**Workaround**

To resolve the problem, complete the steps in
[Velero backups of vSphere persistent volumes fail on Kubernetes clusters version 1.20 or higher (83314)](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/83314)
in the VMware Tanzu Knowledge Base.

<hr>

#### <a id="1-14-0-creating-two-windows-clusters-fails"></a> Creating Two Windows Clusters at the Same Time Fails

**Symptom**

The first time that you try to create two Windows clusters at the same time, the creation of one of
the clusters fails. If you run `pks cluster CLUSTER-NAME` to examine the last action taken on the
cluster, you see the following:

<pre class="terminal">
Last Action: Create
Last Action State: failed
Last Action Description: Instance provisioning failed: There was a problem completing your request.
. . .
operation: create, error-message: Failed to acquire lock
. . .
locking task id is 111, description: 'create deployment'
</pre>

**Explanation**

This is a known issue that occurs the first time that you create two Windows clusters concurrently.

**Workaround**

#### <a id="1-14-0-delete-cluster-not-stopped"></a> Deleted Clusters are Listed in Cluster Lists

**Symptom**

After running `tkgi delete-cluster` and cluster deletion has completed,
the deleted cluster continues to be listed when running `tkgi clusters`.

**Workaround**

You must manually remove the deleted cluster using a customized version of the ncp_cleanup script.

#### <a id="1-14-0-errors-after-reinstall"></a> BOSH Director Logs the Error 'Duplicate vm extension name'

**Symptom**

After you uninstall <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>, then reinstall <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> in the same environment,
BOSH Director logs errors similar to the following:

```
.../gems/bosh-director-0.0.0/lib/bosh/director/deployment_plan/cloud_manifest_parser.rb:120:in `parse_vm_extensions': Duplicate vm extension name 'disk_enable_uuid' (Bosh::Director::DeploymentDuplicateVmExtensionName)
```

**Explanation**

The `pivotal-container-service` cloud-config was not removed when you uninstalled the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> tile,
and it remained active.
When you reinstalled the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> tile, an additional `pivotal-container-service` cloud-config was created,
causing the metrics_server to fall into a crash-loop state.

**Workaround**

You must manually remove the `pivotal-container-service` cloud-config after removing your <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> deployment,
including after removing the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> tile from Ops Manager.

#### <a id="1-14-0-ovsdb-server-failure"></a> Occasionally update-cluster Does Not Complete for Windows Workers

Occasionally, `tkgi update-cluster` hangs while updating a Windows worker node instance and the BOSH task cannot finish and exits.

**Symptom**

The `ovsdb-server` service has stopped but other processes report that it is running.

**Explanation**

The `ovsdb-server.pid` file uses the pid for a process that is not the ovsdb-server.

To confirm that this is the root cause for `tkgi update-cluster` to hang:

* To verify the `ovsdb-server` service has actually stopped, run the PowerShell `Get-services` command on the Windows worker node.
* To verify that other processes report the `ovsdb-server` service is still running:
<br>
    1. Review the ovsdb-server `job-service-wrapper.err.log` log file.
<br>
        The `job-service-wrapper.err.log` log file is located at:

        ```
        C:\var\vcap\sys\log\openvswitch-windows\ovsdb-server\job-service-wrapper.err.log
        ```
    1. Confirm that after the flushing processes, the log includes an error similar to the following:

        ```
        Pid-Guard : ovsdb-server is already runing, please stop it first
        At C:\var\vcap\jobs\openvswitch-windows\bin\ovsdb-server_ctl.ps1:30 char:5
        +     Pid-Guard $PIDFILE "ovsdb-server"
        +     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
            + CategoryInfo          : NotSpecified: ( [Write-Error], WriteErrorException
            + FullyQualifiedErrorId : Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.WriteErrorException,Pid-Guard
        ```
* To verify the root cause:
<br>
    1. Run the following PowerShell commands on the Windows worker node:

        ```
        $RUN_DIR = "C:\var\vcap\sys\run\openvswitch-windows"
        $PIDFILE = "$RUN_DIR\ovsdb-server.pid"
        $pid1 = Get-Content $PidFile -First 1
        echo $pid1
        $rst = Get-Process -Id $pid1 -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
        echo $rst
        ```
    1. Confirm the returned `ProcessName` is not `ovsdb-server`.

**Workaround**

To resolve this issue for a single Windows worker:

1. SSH to the affected worker node.
1. Run the following:

    ```
    rm C:\var\vcap\sys\run\openvswitch-windows\ovsdb-server.pid
    ```
1. Wait for the `ovsdb-server` process to start.
1. Confirm the dependent services also start.

#### <a id="1-14-0-stemcell-tar-support"></a> Deployments Fail on <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Windows Worker-based Kubernetes Clusters after the January 2022 Microsoft Windows Security Patch

Microsoft changed Microsoft Windows' support for tar file commands in the January 2022 Microsoft Windows security patch.

Packaging scripts that use tar commands for Windows worker-based Kubernetes Cluster deployments
can fail after the Microsoft tar command patch update has been applied.

The BOSH agent used by vSphere stemcells built by stembuild v2019.43 and earlier use tar commands that are no longer supported
and will fail if the Microsoft Windows security patch has been applied.


**Workaround**

Stembuild v2019.44 and later include a version of the BOSH agent that does not use unsupported tar commands.

If you use vSphere stemcells, use Stembuild 2019.44 or later to avoid the BOSH agent tar error.

#### <a id="1-14-0-fip-ip-reuse"></a> <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Reallocates Network Profile-Allocated FIP Pool Addresses

**Symptom**

The pre-start script for `tkgi create-cluster` fails and logs floating IP pool allocation errors in the `pre-start.stderr.log` similar to the following:

```
level=error msg="operation failed with [POST /pools/ip-pools/{pool-id}][409] allocateOrReleaseFromIpPoolConflict  &{RelatedAPIError:{Details: ErrorCode:5141 ErrorData:<nil> ErrorMessage:Requested IP Address ... is already allocated. ModuleName:id-allocation service} RelatedErrors:[]}\n"

#### <a id="1-14-0-csi-proxy-issue"></a> Automatic vSphere CSI Driver Integration Ignores Proxy Configuration

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.14.1](#1-14-1-bug-fixes).

In an environment configured with a proxy, automatic vSphere CSI Driver Integration ignores the configured proxy and fails.

**Symptom**

In environments configured with a Proxy and automatic **vSphere CSI Driver Integration** enabled,
the `csi-controller` and `csi-syncer` services log errors similar to the following and fail:

```
"caller":"vsphere/virtualcenter.go:154","msg":"failed to create new client with err: Post \"...\": dial tcp: lookup ...: no such host"
```

**Workaround**

To configure the vSphere CSI Driver to use your proxy:

1. SSH to <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Control Plane VM.

1. Open the `/var/vcap/jobs/csi-controller/bin/csi_controller_ctl` configuration file for editing.

1. Locate the `start_csi_controller` function in the configuration file:

    ```
    start_csi_controller()
    {
        ...
        export ...
        export ...
        export ...
        ...
    }
    ```
1. Locate the `export` commands in the `start_csi_controller` function
and add the following to the group of export commands:

    ```
    export HTTP_PROXY=HTTP-PROXY
    export HTTPS_PROXY=HTTPS-PROXY
    export NO_PROXY=NO-PROXY
    ```

    Where:

    * `HTTP-PROXY` is the HTTP Proxy that the vSphere CSI Driver must use.
    * `HTTPS-PROXY` is the HTTPS Proxy that the vSphere CSI Driver must use.
    * `NO-PROXY` is a list of host names that the vSphere CSI Driver should not use a proxy for.

1. Restart the `csi_controller`:

    ```
    sudo monit restart csi_controller
    ```

#### <a id="1-14-0-pause-image-not-pulled"></a> Windows Pause Image Not Pulled from Private Harbor Registry

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.14.1](#1-14-1-bug-fixes).

**Symptom**

Your Windows clusters using the containerd container runtime in an air-gapped environment always attempt to pull the Windows pause image from
`projects-stg.registry.vmware.com/v2/tkg/pause/manifests/3.4.1-windows-amd64` instead of your designated Harbor registry.

Errors similar to the following are logged when the cluster fails to pull the Windows pause image:

```

or established connection failed because connected host has failed to respond.
```

**Workaround**

You can work around this issue using your existing container runtime or swapping container runtimes.

For each Windows Worker:

* To continue using the containerd container runtime in your cluster:

    1. Manually pull the desired Windows image to the worker.
    1. Tag the image: `projects-stg.registry.vmware.com/v2/tkg/pause/manifests/3.4.1-windows-amd64`.

* To switch to the Docker container runtime to resolve this issue:

    1. Complete the steps in [Switch a Cluster to a Different Container Runtime](checklist.html#migrate-runtime) in
    _Upgrade Preparation Checklist for Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition_.

#### <a id="1-14-0-docker-commands-disabled"></a> Docker Commands No Longer Work on Worker VMs

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.14.1](#1-14-1-bug-fixes).

Clusters using the Docker container runtime no longer default to supporting Docker command line commands.

Supporting containerd as the default container runtime requires Docker-specific features incompatible with containerd are disabled by default.

**Workaround**

In an environment where you want to run Docker commands, complete one of the following:

* Export the Docker environments variables before using Docker commands:

    ```
    source /var/vcap/jobs/docker/bin/envrc
    ```

    For example:

    ```
    source /var/vcap/jobs/docker/bin/envrc

    docker images
    REPOSITORY                                                                   TAG                                        IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE

    ```

* Use absolute Docker paths when referencing Docker:

    ```
    /var/vcap/packages/docker/bin/docker --host unix:///var/vcap/sys/run/docker/docker.sock
    ```

    For example:

    ```
    /var/vcap/packages/docker/bin/docker --host unix:///var/vcap/sys/run/docker/docker.sock images
    REPOSITORY                                                                   TAG                                        IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE

#### <a id="1-14-0-vm-extensions-toggle"></a> Custom BOSH vm_extensions Configuration Settings Applied Inconsistently to Cluster VMs

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.14.1](#1-14-1-bug-fixes).

A vm_extensions configuration will not be applied consistently to the VMs in a cluster
if the initial application of the configuration was interrupted by an error.

**Explanation**

A cluster will have an inconsistency between its cloud-config and BOSH manifest if the
initial application of a vm_extensions configuration is interrupted and fails.
The inconsistency results because BOSH rolls back manifest changes after an error occurs
but there is not a corresponding function that rolls back the cluster cloud-config changes.

Attempting to re-apply the vm_extensions configuration to the cluster has no effect because
the cluster cloud-config indicates the cluster has already been updated.

**Workaround**

1. To export the cloud-config of the cluster with vm_extensions configuration inconsistencies:

    ```
    bosh configs --type=cloud --name=BOSH-DEPLOYMENT > YAML-FILENAME
    ```

    Where:

    * `BOSH-DEPLOYMENT` is the `service-instance_`-prefixed BOSH deployment name.
    * `YAML-FILENAME` is the output YAML file name.

    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">
    bosh config --type=cloud --name=service-instance_cdd7f46b-3151-4d67-85a6-5531fa456b71 > service-instance_cdd7f46b-3151-4d67-85a6-5531fa456b71-cloud-config.yaml
    </pre>

1. (Optional) Create a backup of the cloud-config you just exported:

    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">
    cp service-instance_cdd7f46b-3151-4d67-85a6-5531fa456b71-cloud-config.yaml service-instance_cdd7f46b-3151-4d67-85a6-5531fa456b71-cloud-config-withextension.yaml
    </pre>

1. Open the exported cloud-config in an editor.
1. Remove the vm_extensions added by the interrupted vm_extensions configuration
that are tagged with "`master-vmext`" and "`worker-vmext`".

    You do not need to delete the default configuration tagged with "`master-nsgroup`"
    that was also added by the interrupted vm_extensions configuration.
1. Save your modified exported cloud-config.
1. Locate the UAA credentials for the environment.
See **Credentials** > **uaa_client_credentials** in the <%= vars.product_tile %> Tile.

1. Export `BOSH_CLIENT` and `BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET` using the UAA credentials collected above.

    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">export BOSH_CLIENT=pivotal-container-service-5531fa456b7185a646bc
    export BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET='4d6785a65531fa456c'
    </pre>

1. To update cluster specific cloud-config:

    ```
    bosh update-config --type=cloud --name=BOSH-DEPLOYMENT YAML-FILENAME
    ```

    Where:

    * `BOSH-DEPLOYMENT` is the `service-instance_`-prefixed BOSH deployment name.
    * `YAML-FILENAME` is your modified exported cloud-config YAML file name.

    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">bosh update-config --type=cloud --name=service-instance_cdd7f46b-3151-4d67-85a6-5531fa456b71 service-instance_cdd7f46b-3151-4d67-85a6-5531fa456b71-cloud-config.yaml</pre>

1. If you are updating a cluster that uses a public cloud CSI driver, 
see [Limitations on Using a Public Cloud CSI Driver](release-notes.html#1-15-0-csi-driver-limits) 
in _Release Notes_ for additional requirements.  

1. To update the cluster recreate VMs with the correct manifest:

    ```
    tkgi update-cluster CLUSTER-NAME --config-file CONFIG-FILENAME
    ```

    Where:

    * `CLUSTER-NAME` is the name of your cluster.
    * `CONFIG-FILENAME` is the filename of your vm_extensions configuration file.

    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">tkgi update-cluster pks-cluster-55 --config-file bosh-extension.json</pre>

#### <a id="management-console-1-14-0-vrli-https"></a> vRealize Log Insight Integration Does Not Support HTTPS Connections

**Symptom**

The <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console integration to vRealize Log Insight does not support connections to the HTTPS port on the vRealize Log Insight server.

**Workaround**

1. Use SSH to log in to the <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console appliance VM.
1. Open the file `/lib/systemd/system/pks-loginsight.service` in a text editor.
1. Add `-e LOG_SERVER_ENABLE_SSL_VERIFY=false`.
1. Set `-e LOG_SERVER_USE_SSL=true`.

    The resulting file should look like the following example:

    ```
    ExecStart=/bin/docker run --privileged --restart=always --network=pks
    -v /var/log/journal:/var/log/journal
    --name=pks-loginsight
    -e TYPE=gear2-vm
    -e LOG_SERVER_HOST=${LOGINSIGHT_HOST}
    -e LOG_SERVER_PORT=${LOGINSIGHT_PORT}
    -e LOG_SERVER_ENABLE_SSL_VERIFY=false
    -e LOG_SERVER_USE_SSL=true
    -e LOG_SERVER_AGENT_ID=${LOGINSIGHT_ID}
    pksoctopus/vrli-journald:v07092019
    ```

1. Save the file and run `systemctl daemon-reload`.
1. To restart the vRealize Log Insight service, run `systemctl restart pks-loginsight.service`.

<%= vars.product_short %> Management Console can now send logs to the HTTPS port on the vRealize Log Insight server.

#### <a id="management-console-1-14-0-vsphere-ha"></a> vSphere HA causes Management Console ovfenv Data Corruption

**Symptom**

If you enable vSphere HA on a cluster, if the TKGI Management Console appliance VM is running on a
host in that cluster, and if the host reboots, vSphere HA recreates a new TKGI Management Console
appliance VM on another host in the cluster. Due to an issue with vSphere HA, the `ovfenv` data for
the newly created appliance VM is corrupted and the new appliance VM does not boot up with the
correct network configuration.

**Workaround**

1. In the vSphere Client, right-click the appliance VM and select **Power** > **Shut Down Guest OS**.
1. Right-click the appliance again and select Edit Settings.
1. Select **VM Options** and click **OK**.
1. Verify under Recent Tasks that a `Reconfigure virtual machine` task has run on the appliance VM.
1. Power on the appliance VM.

#### <a id="management-console-1-14-0-k8s-profile"></a> Base64 encoded file arguments are not decoded in Kubernetes profiles

**Symptom**

Some file arguments in Kubernetes profiles are base64 encoded. When the management console displays
the Kubernetes profile, some file arguments are not decoded.

**Workaround**

Run `echo "$content" | base64 --decode`

<hr>

#### <a id="management-console-1-14-0-network-profile"></a> Network profiles not immediately selectable

**Symptom**

If you create network profiles and then try to apply them in the Create Cluster page, the new
profiles are not available for selection.

**Workaround**

Log out of the management console and log back in again.

<hr>

#### <a id="management-console-1-14-0-cluster-summary"></a> Real-Time IP information not displayed for network profiles

**Symptom**

In the cluster summary page, only default IP pool, pod IP block, node IP block values are displayed,
rather than the real-time values from the associated network profile.

**Workaround**

None

<hr>
#### <a id="management-console-1-14-0-harbor-storage-config"></a> Error After Modifying Your Harbor Storage Configuration

**Symptom**

You receive the following error after modifying your existing Harbor installation's storage configuration:

```
Error response from daemon: manifest for ... not found: manifest unknown: manifest unknown
```

**Explanation**

Harbor does not support modifying an existing Harbor installation's storage configuration.

**Workaround**

To modify your Harbor storage configuration,
re-install Harbor. Before starting Harbor, configure the new Harbor installation with the desired configuration.

#### <a id="management-console-1-14-0-re-import-windows-stemcell"></a> Windows Stemcells Must be Re-Imported After Upgrading Ops Manager

**Symptom**

After upgrading Ops Manager, your Management Console does not recognize a Windows stemcell imported
when using the prior version of Ops Manager.

**Workaround**

If your Management Console does not recognize a Windows stemcell after upgrading Ops Manager:

1. Re-import your previously imported Windows stemcell.
2. **Apply Changes** to <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> MC.

<hr>

#### <a id="management-console-1-14-0-cluster-group-name"></a> Your New Clusters Are Not Shown In Tanzu Mission Control

**Symptom**

After you create a cluster, Tanzu Mission Control does not include the cluster in cluster lists.
You have a "_Resource not found_" error similar to the following in your BOSH logs:

```
Cluster Name in TMC: cluster-1
Cluster Name Prefix: tkgi-my-prefix-
Group Name in TMC: my-prefix-clusters
Cluster Description in TMC: VMware Enterprise PKS Attaching cluster ''tkgi-my-prefix-cluster-1'' to TMC
Fetching token successful
request POST:/v1alpha1/clusters,
response 404 Not Found:{"error":"Resource not found - clustergroup(my-prefix-clusters)
org id(d859dc9f-g622-426d-8c91-939a9f13dea9)",
"code":5,"message":"Resource not found - clustergroup(my-prefix-clusters)
```

**Explanation**

The cluster group you assign a cluster to must be defined in Tanzu Mission Control
before you assign your cluster to the cluster group in the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Management Console.

**Workaround**

To resolve the problem, complete the steps in
[Attaching a Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated (TKGI) cluster to Tanzu Mission Control (TMC) fails with "Resource not found - clustergroup(cluster-group-name)"](https://community.pivotal.io/s/article/tkgi-tmc-attach-fail)
in the VMware Tanzu Knowledge Base.
