* Namespace sinks
* NCP v2.3 pre-GA
* PKS can be deployed on Amazon Wen Services (AWS)
* Support to specify the number of worker nodes to be installed in parallel

* Support for Horizontal Pod Autoscaling
* Support for the HostPort feature to allow pods to open external ports on the worker node.
* ETCD release v3.3.9
* Updated admission-controllers based on Kubernetes recommendations including DefaultTolerationSeconds and ValidatingAdminssionWebhook. NamespaceExists has been removed.

* Existing certificates will expire after a year, the certificates will be updated in a future release.
* The External Groups Whitelist has a 4000 character limit due to the size limitation of JWT tokens.
* In an internetless environment the images for the kube system components must be present within the environment to allow the overlay2 upgrade.
* Kubernetes end users must manually configure their kubeconfig in order to use their LDAP credentials if OIDC is turned on.
* UAA refresh token for OIDC authorization is currently not supported.
* The '\' character cannot be used in the external hostname.
* When Enable UAA as an OIDC Provider is selected in UAA the Kubernetes dashboard no longer works with the kubeconfig option. External identity providers or certificate-based authentication are not supported at this time in Kubernetes.

### <a id="v1.2.0-beta-1-known-issues"></a>Known Issues

* If you use stemcell v3586.18 or later
in the 3586 line of Linux stemcells
when deploying PKS on GCP, you may see the following:

  * The output of the `bosh vms` command
  shows an error message that includes `unresponsive agent`.
  * Your PKS-provisioned Kubernetes cluster does not respond to any PKS CLI commands,
  such as `pks get-credentials` or `pks delete-cluster`.

    Until this issue is resolved,
    use stemcell v3586.16 when deploying PKS on GCP.
