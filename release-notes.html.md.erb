#### <a id="1-13-0-cannot-update-dedicated-tier1"></a> <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Does Not Support Updating Dedicated Tier 1 Clusters

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> does not support updating dedicated Tier 1 clusters.
You can use a Network Profile to create a dedicated Tier 1 cluster, but you cannot use
`tkgi update-cluster` to update the cluster afterward.

<hr>

#### <a id="1-13-0-renamed-ops-man"></a> TKGI MC Unable to Manage TKGI after Restoring the TKGI Control Plane from Backup

**Symptom**

After you restore Ops Manager and the <%= vars.control_plane %> VM from backup,
<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> functions normally, but your <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> MC tabs
include the following error: "...product 'pivotal-container service' is not deployed...".

**Explanation**

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> MC is associated with an Ops Manager with a specific name.
If you rename Ops Manager with a new name while restoring, your <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> MC
will not recognize the restored Ops Manager and cannot manage it.

<hr>

#### <a id="1-13-0-hyperbus-error"></a> Kubernetes Pods on NSX-T Become Stuck in a Creating State

**Symptom**

The pods in your <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Kubernetes clusters on NSX-T become stuck in a
creating state.
The connections between nsx-node-agent and hyperbus repeatedly close, log 
`Couldn't connect to 'tcp://...' (error: 111-Connection refused)`, and have a status of
`COMMUNICATION_ERROR`.

**Explanation**

For information and workaround steps for this Known Issue, see
[Issue 2795268: Connection between nsx-node-agent and hyperbus flips and Kubernetes pod is stuck at creating state](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center/3.1/rn/NSX-Container-Plugin-312-Release-Notes.html#RNA_11559)
in _NSX Container Plugin 3.1.2 Release Notes_ in the VMware documentation.

#### <a id="1-13-0-nsxt-302-310"></a> Pods Stop After Upgrading From NSX-T v3.0.2 to v3.1.0 on vSphere 7.0 and 7.0.1

**Symptom**

Your TKGI-provisioned Pods stop after upgrading from NSX-T v3.0.2 to NSX-T v3.1.0 on vSphere 7.0 and 7.0.1.

**Explanation**

For information, see [Issue 2603550: Some VMs are vMotioned and lose network connectivity during UA nodes upgrade]
(https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center/3.1/rn/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center-311-Release-Notes.html#2603550) in the _VMware NSX-T Data Center 3.1.1 Release Notes_.

**Workaround**

To avoid the loss of network connectivity during UA node upgrade, ensure DRS is set to manual mode
during your upgrade from NSX-T v3.0.2 to v3.1.0.

If you upgraded to NSX-T v3.1.0 with DRS in automation mode, run the following on the affected
Pods' control plane VMs to restore Pod connectivity:

```
monit restart ncp
```

For more information about upgrading NSX-T v3.0.2 to NSX-T v3.1.0, see
[Upgrade NSX-T Data Center to v3.0 or v3.1](upgrade-nsxt.html#upgrade-nsxt).

#### <a id="1-13-0-azure-apply-changes"></a> Error: Could Not Execute "Apply-Changes" in Azure Environment

**Symptom**

After clicking **Apply Changes** on the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> tile in an Azure environment,
you experience an error '_...could not execute "apply-changes"..._' with either of the following descriptions:

* _{"errors":{"base":["undefined method 'location' for nil:NilClass"]}}_
* _FailedError.new("Resource Groups in region '#{location}' do not support Availability Zones"))_

For example:

```

```

**Explanation**

The Azure CPI endpoint used by Ops Manager has been changed and 
your installed version of Ops Manager is not compatible with the new endpoint.

**Workaround**

Run the following Ops Manager CLI command:

```
om --skip-ssl-validation --username USERNAME --password PASSWORD --target https://OPSMAN-API curl --silent --path /api/v0/staged/director/verifiers/install_time/IaasConfigurationVerifier -x PUT -d '{ "enabled": false }'
```

Where:

* `USERNAME` is the account to use to run Ops Manager API commands.
* `PASSWORD` is the password for the account.
* `OPSMAN-API` is the IP address for the Ops Manager API

#### <a id="1-13-0-in-windows-notready-nodes"></a> Windows Cluster Nodes Not Deleted After VM Deleted

**Symptom**

After you delete a VM using the management console of your infrastructure provider, you notice a Windows worker node
that had been on that VM is now in a `notReady` state.

**Solution**

1. To identify the leftover node:

    ```
    kubectl get no -o wide
    ```
1. Locate nodes on the returned list that are in a `notReady` state and have the same IP address as another node in the list.
1. To manually delete a `notReady` node:

    ```
    kubectl delete node NODE-NAME
    ```
    Where `NODE-NAME` is the name of the node in the `notReady` state.

#### <a id="1-13-0-oidc-response-header"></a>502 Bad Gateway After OIDC Login

**Symptom**

You experience a "502 Bad Gateway" error from the NSX load balancer after you log in to OIDC.

**Explanation**

A large response header has exceeded your NSX-T load balancer maximum
response header size. The default maximum response header size is 10,240 characters and should
be resized to 50,000.

**Workaround**

If you experience this issue, manually reconfigure your NSX-T `request_header_size`
and `response_header_size` to 50,000 characters.
For information about configuring NSX-T default header sizes,
see [OIDC Response Header Overflow](https://community.pivotal.io/s/article/OIDC-Response-Header-overflow) in the Knowledge Base.

#### <a id="1-13-0-resizing-worker-nodes"></a> Ingress Controller Statefulset Fails to Start After Resizing Worker Nodes

**Symptom** 

Permissions are removed from your cluster's files and processes after resizing the persistent disk
during a cluster upgrade. The ingress controller statefulset fails to start.

**Explanation** 

When resizing a persistent disk, Bosh migrates the data from the old disk to the new disk but
does not copy the files' extended attributes.

**Workaround** 

To resolve the problem, complete the steps in
[Ingress controller statefulset fails to start after resize of worker nodes with permission denied]

<hr>

#### <a id="1-13-0-security-group"></a>Azure Default Security Group Is Not Automatically Assigned to Cluster VMs

**Symptom**

You experience issues when configuring a load balancer for a multi-control plane node Kubernetes cluster or creating a service of type `LoadBalancer`.
Additionally, in the Azure portal, the **VM** > **Networking** page does not display
any inbound and outbound traffic rules for your cluster VMs.

**Explanation**

As part of configuring the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile for Azure, you enter **Default Security Group** in the **Kubernetes Cloud Provider** pane.
When you create a Kubernetes cluster, <%= vars.product_short %> automatically assigns this security group to each VM in the cluster.
However, on Azure the automatic assignment may not occur.

As a result, your inbound and outbound traffic rules defined in the security group are not applied to the cluster VMs.

**Workaround**

If you experience this issue, manually assign the default security group to each VM NIC in your cluster.

<hr>

#### <a id="1-13-0-uuid-length"></a> One Plan ID Longer than Other Plan IDs

**Symptom**

One of your plan IDs is one character longer than your other plan IDs.

**Explanation**

In <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>, each plan has a unique plan ID.
A plan ID is normally a UUID consisting of 32 alphanumeric characters and 4 hyphens.
However, the **Plan 4** ID consists of 33 alphanumeric characters and 4 hyphens.

**Solution**

You can safely configure and use **Plan 4**.
The length of the **Plan 4** ID does not affect the functionality of **Plan 4** clusters.

If you require all plan IDs to have identical length, do not activate or use **Plan 4**.

<hr>

#### <a id="1-13-0-db-down-after-vm-stopped"></a> Database Cluster Stops After a Database Instance is Stopped

**Symptom**

After you stop one instance in a multiple-instance database cluster, the cluster stops,
or communication between the remaining databases times out, and the entire cluster becomes unreachable.

The following might be in your UAA log:

```
WSREP has not yet prepared node for application use
```

**Explanation**

The database cluster is unable to recover automatically because a member is no longer available to reconcile quorum.

<hr>

#### <a id="1-13-0-delete-cluster-not-stopped"></a> Deleted Clusters are Listed in Cluster Lists

**Symptom**

After running `tkgi delete-cluster` and cluster deletion has completed,
the deleted cluster continues to be listed when running `tkgi clusters`.

**Workaround**

You must manually remove the deleted cluster using a customized version of the ncp_cleanup script.
For more information, see
[Deleting a Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition cluster with "tkgi delete-cluster" stuck "in progress" status](https://community.pivotal.io/s/article/pks-delete-cluster-in-progress-after-the-cluster-has-been-deleted?language=en_US)

```

**Explanation**

The `pivotal-container-service` cloud-config was not removed when you uninstalled the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> tile,
and it remained active.
When you reinstalled the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> tile, an additional `pivotal-container-service` cloud-config was created,
causing the metrics_server to fall into a crash-loop state. 

**Workaround**

You must manually remove the `pivotal-container-service` cloud-config after removing your <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> deployment,
including after removing the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> tile from Ops Manager. 

For more information, see ["Duplicate vm extension name" error when metrics_server runs on Director VM in Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition](https://community.pivotal.io/s/article/5000e00001oHXvP1631027033087?language=en_US)

#### <a id="1-13-0-ovsdb-server-failure"></a> Occasionally update-cluster Does Not Complete for Windows Workers

Occasionally, `tkgi update-cluster` hangs while updating a Windows worker node instance and the BOSH task cannot finish and exits.  

**Symptom**

The `ovsdb-server` service has stopped but other processes report that it is running.  

**Explanation**

The `ovsdb-server.pid` file uses the pid for a process that is not the ovsdb-server.

To confirm that this is the root cause for `tkgi update-cluster` to hang:

* To verify the `ovsdb-server` service has actually stopped, run the PowerShell `Get-services` command on the Windows worker node.  
* To verify that other processes report the `ovsdb-server` service is still running:
<br>
    1. Review the ovsdb-server `job-service-wrapper.err.log` log file.  
<br>
        The `job-service-wrapper.err.log` log file is located at:  
        
        ```
        C:\var\vcap\sys\log\openvswitch-windows\ovsdb-server\job-service-wrapper.err.log
        ```
    1. Confirm that after the flushing processes, the log includes an error similar to the following:  

        ```
        Pid-Guard : ovsdb-server is already runing, please stop it first
        At C:\var\vcap\jobs\openvswitch-windows\bin\ovsdb-server_ctl.ps1:30 char:5
        +     Pid-Guard $PIDFILE "ovsdb-server"
        +     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
            + CategoryInfo          : NotSpecified: ( [Write-Error], WriteErrorException
            + FullyQualifiedErrorId : Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.WriteErrorException,Pid-Guard
        ```
* To verify the root cause:
<br>
    1. Run the following PowerShell commands on the Windows worker node:  
    
        ```
        $RUN_DIR = "C:\var\vcap\sys\run\openvswitch-windows"
        $PIDFILE = "$RUN_DIR\ovsdb-server.pid"
        $pid1 = Get-Content $PidFile -First 1
        echo $pid1
        $rst = Get-Process -Id $pid1 -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
        echo $rst
        ```
    1. Confirm the returned `ProcessName` is not `ovsdb-server`.
    
**Workaround**

To resolve this issue for a single Windows worker:  

1. SSH to the affected worker node.  
1. Run the following:   

    ```
    rm C:\var\vcap\sys\run\openvswitch-windows\ovsdb-server.pid
    ```
1. Wait for the `ovsdb-server` process to start.  
1. Confirm the dependent services also start.

#### <a id="1-13-0-ncp-k8s-122"></a> Existing NSX-T Load Balancer Domain Ingress Rules Override Newer Subdomain Ingress Rules

On <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.13 and later, on vSphere with NSX-T, if you apply a load balancer ingress rule to a domain 
before applying ingress rules to subdomains, the domain ingress rule is applied to both the domain and the subdomains, 
and the subdomain ingress rules are ignored.

**Explanation**

With Kubernetes v1.22 and NCP v3.2.0, load balancer ingress rules are applied to domains and subdomains via regex pattern matching 
instead of exact-match pattern matching. 
The load balancer subdomains match the specified domain ingress rule pattern and the subsequent subdomain ingress rules are ignored.


**Workaround**

For newly created ingress rules, specify subdomain rules before rules for their associated domain. 
For example, specify the rules for `api.example.com` and  `mail.example.com` before the rules for `example.com`.

#### <a id="management-console-1-13-0-vrli-https"></a> vRealize Log Insight Integration Does Not Support HTTPS Connections

**Symptom**

The <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console integration to vRealize Log Insight does not support connections to the HTTPS port on the vRealize Log Insight server.

**Workaround**

1. Use SSH to log in to the <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console appliance VM.
1. Open the file `/lib/systemd/system/pks-loginsight.service` in a text editor.
1. Add `-e LOG_SERVER_ENABLE_SSL_VERIFY=false`.
1. Set `-e LOG_SERVER_USE_SSL=true`.

    The resulting file should look like the following example:

    ```
    ExecStart=/bin/docker run --privileged --restart=always --network=pks
    -v /var/log/journal:/var/log/journal
    --name=pks-loginsight
    -e TYPE=gear2-vm
    -e LOG_SERVER_HOST=${LOGINSIGHT_HOST}
    -e LOG_SERVER_PORT=${LOGINSIGHT_PORT}
    -e LOG_SERVER_ENABLE_SSL_VERIFY=false
    -e LOG_SERVER_USE_SSL=true
    -e LOG_SERVER_AGENT_ID=${LOGINSIGHT_ID}
    pksoctopus/vrli-journald:v07092019
    ```

1. Save the file and run `systemctl daemon-reload`.
1. To restart the vRealize Log Insight service, run `systemctl restart pks-loginsight.service`.

<%= vars.product_short %> Management Console can now send logs to the HTTPS port on the vRealize Log Insight server.

#### <a id="management-console-1-13-0-vsphere-ha"></a> vSphere HA causes Management Console ovfenv Data Corruption

**Symptom**

If you enable vSphere HA on a cluster, if the TKGI Management Console appliance VM is running on a
host in that cluster, and if the host reboots, vSphere HA recreates a new TKGI Management Console
appliance VM on another host in the cluster. Due to an issue with vSphere HA, the `ovfenv` data for
the newly created appliance VM is corrupted and the new appliance VM does not boot up with the
correct network configuration.

**Workaround**

1. In the vSphere Client, right-click the appliance VM and select **Power** > **Shut Down Guest OS**.
1. Right-click the appliance again and select Edit Settings.
1. Select **VM Options** and click **OK**.
1. Verify under Recent Tasks that a `Reconfigure virtual machine` task has run on the appliance VM.
1. Power on the appliance VM.

#### <a id="management-console-1-13-0-k8s-profile"></a> Base64 encoded file arguments are not decoded in Kubernetes profiles

**Symptom**

Some file arguments in Kubernetes profiles are base64 encoded. When the management console displays
the Kubernetes profile, some file arguments are not decoded.

**Workaround**

Run `echo "$content" | base64 --decode`

<hr>

#### <a id="management-console-1-13-0-network-profile"></a> Network profiles not immediately selectable

**Symptom**

If you create network profiles and then try to apply them in the Create Cluster page, the new
profiles are not available for selection.

**Workaround**

Log out of the management console and log back in again.

<hr>

#### <a id="management-console-1-13-0-cluster-summary"></a> Real-Time IP information not displayed for network profiles

**Symptom**

In the cluster summary page, only default IP pool, pod IP block, node IP block values are displayed,
rather than the real-time values from the associated network profile.

**Workaround**

None

#### <a id="management-console-1-13-0-harbor-storage-config"></a> Error After Modifying Your Harbor Storage Configuration

**Symptom**

You receive the following error after modifying your existing Harbor installation's storage configuration:

```
Error response from daemon: manifest for ... not found: manifest unknown: manifest unknown
```

**Explanation**

Harbor does not support modifying an existing Harbor installation's storage configuration.

**Workaround**

To modify your Harbor storage configuration,

#### <a id="management-console-1-13-0-re-import-windows-stemcell"></a> Windows Stemcells Must be Re-Imported After Upgrading Ops Manager

**Symptom**

After upgrading Ops Manager, your Management Console does not recognize a Windows stemcell imported
when using the prior version of Ops Manager.

**Workaround**

If your Management Console does not recognize a Windows stemcell after upgrading Ops Manager:

1. Re-import your previously imported Windows stemcell. 
2. **Apply Changes** to <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> MC.

#### <a id="management-console-1-13-0-cluster-group-name"></a> Your New Clusters Are Not Shown In Tanzu Mission Control

**Symptom**

After you create a cluster, Tanzu Mission Control does not include the cluster in cluster lists.
You have a "_Resource not found_" error similar to the following in your BOSH logs:

```
Cluster Name in TMC: cluster-1
Cluster Name Prefix: tkgi-my-prefix-
Group Name in TMC: my-prefix-clusters
Cluster Description in TMC: VMware Enterprise PKS Attaching cluster ''tkgi-my-prefix-cluster-1'' to TMC
Fetching token successful
request POST:/v1alpha1/clusters,
response 404 Not Found:{"error":"Resource not found - clustergroup(my-prefix-clusters)
org id(d859dc9f-g622-426d-8c91-939a9f13dea9)",
"code":5,"message":"Resource not found - clustergroup(my-prefix-clusters)
```

**Explanation**

The cluster group you assign a cluster to must be defined in Tanzu Mission Control
before you assign your cluster to the cluster group in the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Management Console.

**Workaround** 

To resolve the problem, complete the steps in
[Attaching a Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated (TKGI) cluster to Tanzu Mission Control (TMC) fails with "Resource not found - clustergroup(cluster-group-name)"](https://community.pivotal.io/s/article/tkgi-tmc-attach-fail)
in the VMware Tanzu Knowledge Base.
