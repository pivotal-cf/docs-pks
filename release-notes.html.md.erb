#### <a id="1-10-4-drain-cluster-windows-errand-does-not-exist"></a> "drain-cluster-windows" Errand Does Not Exist 

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.10.5](#1-10-5-features).

**Symptom**

When you delete a Linux cluster, the `drain-cluster-windows` errand reports the following error:

```
Errand 'drain-cluster-windows' doesn't exist
```

**Explanation**

When you delete a cluster, the following errands run:

* `drain-cluster`
* `drain-cluster-windows`

Both errands run regardless of whether the cluster is a Linux or Windows cluster.

On a Linux cluster, the Windows cluster and the `drain-cluster-windows` errand do not exist. The log shows the following:

```
Task 572
Task 572 | 11:39:54 | Preparing deployment: Preparing deployment
Task 572 | 11:39:54 | Deprecation: Global 'properties' are deprecated. Please define 'properties' at the job level.
Task 572 | 11:39:56 | Preparing deployment: Preparing deployment (00:00:02)
 L Error: Errand 'drain-cluster-windows' doesn't exist
Task 572 | 11:39:56 | Error: Errand 'drain-cluster-windows' doesn't exist
Task 572 Started Tue Jun 29 11:39:54 UTC 2021
Task 572 Finished Tue Jun 29 11:39:56 UTC 2021
Task 572 Duration 00:00:02
Task 572 error
```

On a Windows cluster, both the `drain-cluster` and `drain-cluster-windows` errands exist, and no
error messages are generated.

**Workaround**

No workaround is necessary. The error message is informational, accurate, and does not negatively
impact deleting the cluster.

#### <a id="1-10-2-runc-node-notready"></a> Nodes with More Than 30 Stateful Pods Are in a NotReady State

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.10.3](#1-10-3-features).

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> If you have nodes with more than 30 stateful Pods 
    or nodes with a total of more than 50 Pods, do not upgrade to <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.10.2.

**Symptom**  

Nodes that have more than 50 Pods or more than 30 stateful Pods are in a `NotReady` state, 
and you see the following errors in kubelet logs:

```
Error syncing pod ... skipping: rpc error: code = DeadlineExceeded desc = context deadline exceeded
skipping pod synchronization - PLEG is not healthy: pleg was last seen active...
skipping pod synchronization - PLEG is not healthy: pleg was last seen active...
failed to collect filesystem stats - rootDiskErr: could not stat .. to get inode usage: stat ...: no such file or directory, extraDiskErr: could not stat
```

**Explanation**

The runc component has introduced instability into nodes consisting of 50 or more Pods or 30 or more statefulset Pods.

#### <a id='1-10-1-drain-dynamic-pvs'></a> Workloads Using Dynamic PVs Must be Removed Before Deleting a Cluster

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.10.2](#1-10-2-features).

**Symptom**  

Your `tkgi delete-cluster` operation hangs while draining a worker VM containing a Pod bound to one or more dynamic persistent volumes (PVs).  

**Workaround** 

Before deleting the cluster, remove all workloads.

If you have already attempted to delete a cluster and your workloads with dynamic PVs have stopped, 
remove the dynamic PVs attached to the worker VMs in your cluster. 
For information about removing dynamic PVs from a worker VM, see 
[Workloads using dynamic PersistentVolumes (PVs) must be removed before deleting a cluster]
(https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/83403?lang=en_US&queryTerm=000083403) in the Knowledge Base.

### <a id="1-10-0-breaking-changes"></a> Breaking Changes

TKGI v1.10.0 has the following breaking changes. 

#### <a id='1-10-0-nsxt-3'></a> <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.10 Is Not Compatible with NSX-T v2.5.2 or Earlier 

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.10 is not compatible with NSX-T v2.5.2 or earlier. 
If you are deploying <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.10 to NSX-T, your NSX-T version must be 
NSX-T v3.0.1 or later. For more information about upgrading NSX-T and <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>, 
see [Upgrade Order for Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition Environments on vSphere](upgrade-scenarios.html) 
and [Upgrading Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition (NSX-T Networking)](upgrade-nsxt.html).  

#### <a id='1-10-0-swap-disabled'></a> Swap Is Disabled by Default  

Swap is now disabled on all worker nodes. 
In previous versions of <%= vars.product_short %>, Swap was enabled, but upstream Kubernetes does not support this setting. 
You cannot enable swap through the TKGI CLI, and manually configuring swap is not permitted. 

#### <a id='1-10-0-cluster-errors'></a> Cluster Creation, Update and Upgrade Failure Error Messages No Longer Truncated

<%= vars.product_short %> v1.10 includes improved error messages for cluster creation, update and upgrade failures. 
Previously, error messages greater than 128 bytes were truncated. In <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.10 
logged cluster creation and upgrade failure error messages are no longer truncated. 

#### <a id='1-10-0-node-names-match'></a> On NSX-T v3.1 the Transport Zone and Edge Transport Node Switch Names Must be Identical 

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.10.2](#1-10-2-features) and
[<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> MC v1.10.2](#management-console-1-10-2-features).  

The NSX-T Transport Zone and Edge Transport Node switch names must be identical if <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.10 is installed on NSX-T v3.1. 
For more information, see [Configuring NSX-T Data Center v3.1 Transport Zones and Edge Node Switches for <%= vars.product_short %>]
(nsxt-3-1-install-delta.html).

#### <a id='1-10-0-san-required'></a> Kubectl Authentication Requires a Certificate Generated With a SAN

Kubernetes now requires the certificate used for Kubernetes authentication to be generated with a Subject Alternate Name (SAN). 
If you are using OIDC for Kubernetes authentication, the certificate serving the OIDC provider must include a SAN.  

If you provide Kubernetes with a certificate generated without a SAN, kubectl commands will fail with an error: "_You must be logged in to the server (Unauthorized)_".  

###<a id='1-10-0-known-issues'></a>Known Issues

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.10.0 has the following known issues:  

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> VMware recommends that you take steps to mitigate

#### <a id="1-10-0-nsxt-302-310"></a> Pods Stop After Upgrading From NSX-T v3.0.2 to v3.1.0 on vSphere 7.0 and 7.0.1

**Symptom**

Your TKGI-provisioned Pods stop after upgrading from NSX-T v3.0.2 to NSX-T v3.1.0 on vSphere 7.0 and 7.0.1.

**Explanation**

For information, see [Issue 2603550: Some VMs are vMotioned and lose network connectivity during UA nodes upgrade]
(https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center/3.1/rn/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center-311-Release-Notes.html#2603550) in the _VMware NSX-T Data Center 3.1.1 Release Notes_.

**Workaround**

To avoid the loss of network connectivity during UA node upgrade, ensure DRS is set to manual mode during your upgrade from NSX-T v3.0.2 to v3.1.0.

If you upgraded to NSX-T v3.1.0 with DRS in automation mode, run the following on the affected Pods' master VMs to restore Pod connectivity:

```
monit restart ncp
```

For more information on upgrading NSX-T v3.0.2 to NSX-T v3.1.0, see [Upgrade NSX-T Data Center to v3.0 or v3.1](upgrade-nsxt.html#upgrade-nsxt).

**Explanation**

The Azure CPI endpoint used by Ops Manager has been changed and
your installed version of Ops Manager is not compatible with the new endpoint.

**Workaround**

Run the following Ops Manager CLI command:

```
om --skip-ssl-validation --username USERNAME --password PASSWORD --target https://OPSMAN-API curl --silent --path /api/v0/staged/director/verifiers/install_time/IaasConfigurationVerifier -x PUT -d '{ "enabled": false }'
```

Where:

* `USERNAME` is the account to use to run Ops Manager API commands.
* `PASSWORD` is the password for the account.
* `OPSMAN-API` is the IP address for the Ops Manager API

#### <a id="1-10-0-in-windows-notready-nodes"></a> Windows Cluster Nodes Not Deleted After VM Deleted

**Symptom**

After you delete a VM using the management console of your infrastructure provider, you notice a Windows worker node
that had been on that VM is now in a `notReady` state.

**Solution**

1. To identify the leftover node:

    ```
    kubectl get no -o wide
    ```
1. Locate nodes on the returned list that are in a `notReady` state and have the same IP address as another node in the list.
1. To manually delete a `notReady` node:

    ```
    kubectl delete node NODE-NAME
    ```
    Where `NODE-NAME` is the name of the node in the `notReady` state.

#### <a id="1-10-0-oidc-response-header"></a>502 Bad Gateway After OIDC Login

**Symptom**

You experience a "502 Bad Gateway" error from the NSX load balancer after you log in to OIDC.

**Explanation**

A large response header has exceeded your NSX-T load balancer maximum
response header size. The default maximum response header size is 10,240 characters and should
be resized to 50,000.

**Workaround**

If you experience this issue, manually reconfigure your NSX-T `request_header_size`
and `response_header_size` to 50,000 characters.
For information about configuring NSX-T default header sizes,

#### <a id='1-10-0-antrea-logging-interupt'></a> Unexplained Errors After Interrupting a Log Stream When Using Antrea Networking 

**Symptom**

While using Antrea networking, you observe unexplainable errors after you interrupt a log stream started using `kubectl logs -f POD-NAME`. 
The errors could include any of the following:  

* kubectl returns the error: "_Error from server (TooManyRequests): the server has received too many_".   
* `kube-apiserver` returns an http code `429`. 

**Explanation**

When using Antrea networking there is a chance that `konnectivity-agent` will become unstable after interrupting your kubectl log steam.

**Workaround**

To resolve the issue:  

1. Log in to the master VM:

    ```
    bosh -d DEPLOYMENT-NAME ssh master/0
    ````

1. Change to root:

    ```
    sudo -i
    ```

1. Restart `proxy-server`:

#### <a id='1-10-0-resizing-worker-nodes'></a> Ingress Controller Statefulset Fails to Start After Resizing Worker Nodes

**Symptom**  

Permissions are removed from your cluster’s files and processes after resizing the persistent disk 
during a cluster upgrade. The ingress controller statefulset fails to start.

**Explanation**  

When resizing a persistent disk, Bosh migrates the data from the old disk to the new disk but 
does not copy the files’ extended attributes.

**Workaround**

#### <a id="1-10-0-security-group"></a>Azure Default Security Group Is Not Automatically Assigned to Cluster VMs

**Symptom**

You experience issues when configuring a load balancer for a multi-master Kubernetes cluster or creating a service of type `LoadBalancer`.
Additionally, in the Azure portal, the **VM** > **Networking** page does not display
any inbound and outbound traffic rules for your cluster VMs.

**Explanation**

As part of configuring the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile for Azure, you enter **Default Security Group** in the **Kubernetes Cloud Provider** pane.
When you create a Kubernetes cluster, <%= vars.product_short %> automatically assigns this security group to each VM in the cluster.
However, on Azure the automatic assignment may not occur.

As a result, your inbound and outbound traffic rules defined in the security group are not applied to the cluster VMs.

**Workaround**

If you experience this issue, manually assign the default security group to each VM NIC in your cluster.

#### <a id='1-10-0-uuid-length'></a> One Plan ID Longer than Other Plan IDs

**Symptom**

One of your plan IDs is one character longer than your other plan IDs.

**Explanation**

In <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>, each plan has a unique plan ID.
A plan ID is normally a UUID consisting of 32 alphanumeric characters and 4 hyphens.
However, the **Plan 4** ID consists of 33 alphanumeric characters and 4 hyphens.

**Solution**

You can safely configure and use **Plan 4**.
The length of the **Plan 4** ID does not affect the functionality of **Plan 4** clusters.

If you require all plan IDs to have identical length, do not activate or use **Plan 4**.

#### <a id='1-10-0-uppercase-bosh-dns'></a> FQDNs in <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> API Commands Cannot Contain Uppercase Letters

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.10.1](#1-10-1-features).

**Symptom**

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> CLI commands fail with error:

```
Error: An error occurred in the PKS API when processing
```

**Explanation**

BOSH DNS, which <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> uses for its internal DNS, does not support uppercase letters in FQDNs.

**Workaround**

Use only lowercase letters in FQDNs that you assign to your <%= vars.control_plane %> VM in <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>. 

<%#
<%= vars.control_plane %     > logs include errors like:

```

The fully-qualified domain names (FQDNs) that you use for vCenter or the <%= vars.control_plane %       > VM contain uppercase letters.

Running `nslookup` from your <%= vars.control_plane %       > VM succeeds with the FQDN with uppercase letters, but fails when you convert them to lowercase.

**Explanation**

BOSH DNS, which <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %     > uses for its internal DNS, does not support uppercase letters in FQDNs.

**Workaround**

Use only lowercase letters in FQDNs that you assign to your vCenter or <%= vars.control_plane %     > VM in <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %     >.

#### <a id="1-10-0-bosh-stop-doesnt-drain"></a>Certain Linux Nodes Are Unable to Complete the Drain Process during a TKGI Upgrade

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.10.1](#1-10-1-features).

**Symptom**

You may experience one or more of the following:  

* Your cluster upgrades are interrupted when upgrading the second node of a three-node Pod.  
* Pod eviction fails when either `bosh stop` or `tkgi upgrade-cluster` initiates kubectl drain.

**Explanation**

Ovs drain has finished, removing Pod networking before kubelet has completely drained the Pod. 
Draining a worker node has triggered the removal of a container interface on the node, 
blocking all network traffic from the Pod.

#### <a id='1-10-0-do-notuse-resize-cluster'></a>TKGI CLI Resize and Update Cluster Commands Remove Network Profile CNI Configuration from a Cluster

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.10.1](#1-10-1-features).

**Symptom**

In <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.10.0, the network profile CNI configuration is dropped 
when updating the cluster using the `tkgi resize` or `tkgi update-cluster` CLI commands.  

**Solution**

To restore a CNI network profile configuration:  

1. Upgrade <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> to v1.10.1 or later.  
1. Upgrade your <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>-provisioned cluster to <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.10.1 or later.  
1. To restore the network profile CNI configuration to your cluster, modify the cluster using either of the following:
    * The <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> CLI `resize` command:  

        ```
        tkgi resize CLUSTER-NAME
        ```
        Where `CLUSTER-NAME` is the name of your cluster.  
        * The <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> CLI `update-cluster` command:  
    * The <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> CLI `update-cluster` command:  

        ```
        tkgi update-cluster CLUSTER-NAME --network-profile PROFILE-NAME
        ```
        Where:
        * `CLUSTER-NAME` is the name of your cluster.
        * `PROFILE-NAME` is the name of the network profile previously applied to the cluster.

#### <a id='1-10-0-stale-ip-problem'></a> Your Cluster Returns the Error 'PodCIDR is Empty for Node'

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.10.1](#1-10-1-features).

**Symptom**

While using Antrea as your CNI, your cluster experiences connectivity issues, 
such as the overlay network failing to communicate with worker nodes. 
Your logs include errors, such as "_PodCIDR is empty for Node..._",
even though podCIDR is correctly configured and all Pods in your cluster have a running status.  

**Explanation**  

There is a stale IP address in a Pod in your cluster and the current version of Antrea cannot remove it.

**Workaround**

To remove a stale IP address:  

1. To locate a stale IP address:
    1. Verify the Antrea gateway interface has more than one IP address.
    1. If it does have more than one IP address, review the logs for when the IP addresses are initialized. 
    The last Antrea gateway interface IP address in the log is the only valid IP address for the interface. The preceding IP address(es) are stale
     and should be removed.  
1. To delete a stale IP address, run the following:

    ```
    ip addr del IP-ADDRESS dev GATEWAY-NAME
    ```
    Where:
    * `IP-ADDRESS` is the IP address to be removed.
    * `GATEWAY-NAME` is the name of your Antrea gateway.

    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    ip addr del 10.200.1.1/24 dev2 antrea-gw0

#### <a id='1-10-0-failover-mode'></a> Network Profiles Does Not Support the `failover_mode` Parameter

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.10.1](#1-10-1-features).  

**Symptom**

When you attempt to resize or update a cluster, the operation fails with logged errors similar to the following:  

```
Error processing update parameters: Unexpected field 'failover_mode'
```

**Explanation** 

The `failover_mode` network profile parameter has been incorrectly flagged as an unsupported parameter.  

**Workaround**  

To remove the `failover_mode` parameter from a network profile:  

1. Create a copy of the network profile configuration file used by your cluster.  
1. Remove the `failover_mode` parameter from the copy of the configuration file. 
For example, remove:  

    ```
    "failover_mode":"PREEMPTIVE",
    ```
1. Update the network profile for the cluster using the revised configuration file.  

You can now resize your cluster.

#### <a id='1-10-0-fluentd-log-overflow'></a> The <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> API VM fluentd.stdout.log Grows While vRealize Log Insight is Disabled

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.10.4](#1-10-4-features).  

**Symptom**  

While vRealize Log Insight (vRLI) is disabled, the log for `fluentd.stdout` on the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> API VM
grows quite large and rolls over frequently.


**Explanation** 

The fluentd job on the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> API VM automatically starts when vRLI is disabled. 
This fluentd job runs continuously, frequently writing inaccessible hostname errors to stdout 
for the non-existent vRLI endpoint. 
The fluentd stdout on the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> API VM is logged in:

#### <a id='1-10-0-dual-wavefront-collectors'></a> Wavefront Collector is Duplicated or Not Collecting from <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Namespaces

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.10.5](#1-10-5-features).

**Symptom**

After upgrading <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> to <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.10.0 or later, you observe that two Wavefront collectors are running instead of one. 
If one of the collectors stops, the remaining collector alternates between collecting metrics as itself and as the stopped collector. 
The `pks.kubernetes.daemonset.` and `pks.kubernetes.deployment.` namespaces may stop reporting.

**Explanation**

Two instances of Wavefront collector are currently installed and running: a v1.20 DaemonSet collector and a v1.26 Deployment collector. 
Both Wavefront collectors are running and collecting metrics. 
Only the v1.26 Deployment collector instance should be running. 

**Workaround**

You must remove the v1.20 DaemonSet Wavefront collector and leave the v1.26 Deployment collector running.

To remove the DaemonSet Wavefront collector:

1. Save the DaemonSet YAML creation file as `wf_daemonset.yaml`. 
Keep a copy of the file in case you need to restore the DaemonSet Wavefront collector.  

1. To delete the Wavefront Collector DaemonSet:

    ```
    kubectl delete daemonset wavefront-collector -n pks-system
    ```

If you later decide that you need to restore the DaemonSet collector, 
you can restore using the DaemonSet yaml creation file you saved earlier.

1. To restore the DaemonSet collector:

    ```
    kubectl apply -f wf_daemonset.yaml 
    kubetcl get daemonset/wavefront-collector -n pks-system -o yaml > wf_daemonset.yaml
    ```

#### <a id="1-10-0-renamed-ops-man"></a> TKGI MC Unable to Manage TKGI after Restoring the TKGI Control Plane from Backup

**Symptom**

After you restore Ops Manager and the <%= vars.control_plane %> VM from backup, <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> functions normally, 
but your <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> MC tabs include the following error: “…product ‘pivotal-container service’ is not deployed…”. 

**Explanation**

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> MC is associated with an Ops Manager with a specific name. 
If you rename Ops Manager with a new name while restoring, 
your <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> MC will not recognize the restored Ops Manager and cannot manage it.

#### <a id="1-10-0-all-saml-are-signed"></a> SAML Authentication Requests Are Always Signed

**Symptom**

After you disable the SAML Identity Provider **Sign Authentication Requests** setting on the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile, 
SAML IdP authentication requests continue to be signed.

#### <a id="1-10-0-errors-after-reinstall"></a> BOSH Director Logs the Error 'Duplicate vm extension name'

<%#
This issue is fixed in [< %= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr % > v1.10.6](#1-10-6-features).
#%>

**Symptom**

After you uninstall <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>, then reinstall <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> in the same environment, 
BOSH Director logs errors similar to the following:  

```
.../gems/bosh-director-0.0.0/lib/bosh/director/deployment_plan/cloud_manifest_parser.rb:120:in `parse_vm_extensions': Duplicate vm extension name 'disk_enable_uuid' (Bosh::Director::DeploymentDuplicateVmExtensionName)
```

**Explanation**

The `pivotal-container-service` cloud-config was not removed when you uninstalled the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> tile, 
and it remained active.
When you reinstalled the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> tile, an additional `pivotal-container-service` cloud-config was created, 
causing the metrics_server to fall into a crash-loop state.  

**Workaround**

You must manually remove the `pivotal-container-service` cloud-config after removing your <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> deployment, 
including after removing the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> tile from Ops Manager.

#### <a id="1-10-0-azure-hostnames-not-resolved"></a> Node Hostnames Are Not Resolved for BYO DNS in Azure Environments

**Symptom**

If you use a bring-your-own DNS configuration in Azure environments, 
node hostnames are not resolved on your <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> clusters, and kubectl returns a "no such host" error:

```
Error from server: Get "...": dial tcp: lookup ... on ... no such host
```

**Explanation**

On Azure, the Azure CPI uses BOSH `agent_id` GUIDs as the VM name. 
Additionally, the Azure Kubernetes cloud provider mandates the VM name matches the hostname 
and that the hostname is resolvable without using search domains.

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> on Azure relies on Dynamic DNS updates via DHCP to allow resolvable K8s node names. 
Environments with a bring-your-own DNS server configuration must provide an alternative method 
for updating DNS entries.

#### <a id="1-10-0-logs-not-forwarded"></a> Some Kubernetes Logs Are Not Forwarded after Upgrading

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.10.7](#1-10-7-bug-fixes).  

**Symptom**

After you upgrade <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> to v1.10.0, some Kubernetes logs are no longer forwarded by Fluent Bit.

**Explanation**

In <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.10.0, Fluent Bit has been upgraded from v1.3.4 to v1.5.7. 
In Fluent Bit v1.5.7, the default Kubernetes annotation buffer size is 32&nbsp;KB, 
limiting the size of Kubernetes log metadata to 32&nbsp;KB by default. 
The Kubernetes log metadata in your environment exceeds this limit, and the log entries have been discarded.  

**Workaround**

To reduce the length of the Kubernetes metadata applied to your log entries, 
reduce the total size of the Kubernetes annotation environment variables you have defined in your environment.

#### <a id="1-10-0-cvds-with-nvds"></a> <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Does Not Support CVDS / NVDS Mixed Environments

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> does not support environments where there are multiple matching networks, such as a mixed CVDS/NVDS environment.

**Symptom**

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> logs errors similar to the following in an environment with multiple matching networks:

```

#### <a id="1-10-0-worker-node-not-ready"></a> A Worker Node on a Rebooted Windows VM Might Remain Not Ready

**Symptom**

Although a rebooted Windows VM returns to the `running` state, 
a worker node on the running VM might occasionally be duplicated and the original of the duplicates 
remains in the `terminating` state and is not ready.  

**Workaround**

To remove a not ready node from a Kubernetes cluster:

1. Determine which node is in the `terminating` state:  

    ```
    kubectl get nodes 
    ```
1. Remove the old VolumeAttachment bound to the problem node:

    1. To list the VolumeAttachments:
        
        ```
        kubectl get volumeattachment
        ```
    1. Determine which VolumeAttachment is used by the problem node.
    1. To remove the VolumeAttachment from the problem node:  
    
        ```
        kubectl delete volumeattachment ATTACH-NAME
        ```
        Where `ATTACH-NAME` is the VolumeAttachment name.  
        
1. To delete the problem node from the Kubernetes cluster:
    
    ```
    kubectl delete node NODE-NAME
    ```

#### <a id="management-console-1-10-0-vrli-https"></a> vRealize Log Insight Integration Does Not Support HTTPS Connections

**Symptom**

The <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console integration to vRealize Log Insight does not support
connections to the HTTPS port on the vRealize Log Insight server.

**Workaround**

1. Use SSH to log in to the <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console appliance VM.
1. Open the file `/lib/systemd/system/pks-loginsight.service` in a text editor.
1. Add `-e LOG_SERVER_ENABLE_SSL_VERIFY=false`.

    The resulting file should look like the following example:

    ```
    ExecStart=/bin/docker run --privileged --restart=always --network=pks
    -v /var/log/journal:/var/log/journal
    --name=pks-loginsight
    -e TYPE=gear2-vm
    -e LOG_SERVER_HOST=${LOGINSIGHT_HOST}
    -e LOG_SERVER_PORT=${LOGINSIGHT_PORT}
    -e LOG_SERVER_ENABLE_SSL_VERIFY=false
    -e LOG_SERVER_USE_SSL=true
    -e LOG_SERVER_AGENT_ID=${LOGINSIGHT_ID}
    pksoctopus/vrli-journald:v07092019
    ```

1. Save the file and run `systemctl daemon-reload`.
1. To restart the vRealize Log Insight service, run `systemctl restart pks-loginsight.service`.

<%= vars.product_short %> Management Console can now send logs to the HTTPS port on the vRealize Log Insight server.

#### <a id="management-console-1-10-0-vsphere-ha"></a> vSphere HA causes Management Console ovfenv Data Corruption

**Symptom**

If you enable vSphere HA on a cluster, if the TKGI Management Console appliance VM is running on a host
in that cluster, and if the host reboots, vSphere HA recreates a new TKGI Management Console appliance
VM on another host in the cluster. Due to an issue with vSphere HA, the `ovfenv` data for the newly
created appliance VM is corrupted and the new appliance VM does not boot up with the correct network configuration.

**Workaround**

- In the vSphere Client, right-click the appliance VM and select **Power** > **Shut Down Guest OS**.
- Right-click the appliance again and select Edit Settings.
- Select **VM Options** and click **OK**.
- Verify under Recent Tasks that a `Reconfigure virtual machine` task has run on the appliance VM.
- Power on the appliance VM.
