<sup>&#42;</sup> See [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.8 With NSX-T v3.0 Not Compatible With Xenial Stemcells 621.76+ and Ops Manager v2.9.6](#1-8-0-xenial-compat).

<sup>&#42;&#42;</sup> Excluding VCF 4; see [VCF 4 and Converged VDS v7 Not Supported in <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.8](#1-8-0-cvds).

<sup>&#42;&#42;&#42;</sup> <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> supports NSX-T v3.0 as a beta integration. 
Upgrading NSX-T to v3.0 is not recommended for production or large-scale 
<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> environments. 
For more information about NSX-T v3.0 support, 
see [NSX-T v3.0 Compatibility](#1-8-0-nsxt-compat) below.


### <a id='1-8-0-upgrade'></a>Upgrade Path

The supported upgrade paths to <%= vars.product_short %> v1.8.0 are from Enterprise PKS v1.7.0 and later patches.

### <a id="1-8-0-features"></a>Features

This section describes new features and changes in <%= vars.product_full %> v1.8.0.

#### <a id="1-8-0-rebranding"></a>Enterprise PKS Renamed to <%= vars.product_short %>

Enterprise PKS has been renamed to
<%= vars.product_short %> (<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>).

What has changed:

* The <%= vars.product_tile %> v1.8 tile uses the new name.
* <%= vars.product_short %> v1.8 includes
two downloads of the CLI, the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> CLI and PKS CLI.
See [PKS CLI Renamed  to <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> CLI](#1-8-0-tkgi-cli) below.

What has **not** changed:

* Internal components continue to use the old
name and its alternatives, such as `PKS`, `pks`, and `pivotal-container-service`.
This includes, but is not limited to, BOSH names, UAA roles, and text strings
containing the product name in <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> components
and <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>-provisioned clusters.

If you intend to continue using the PKS CLI in <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>
v1.8, no action is required.
However, future releases of <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> will deprecate and remove the PKS CLI.

#### <a id="1-8-0-tkgi-cli"></a>PKS CLI Renamed  to <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> CLI

To support the [product name change](#1-8-0-rebranding), <%= vars.product_short %> v1.8
is distributed with a <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> CLI in addition to a PKS CLI.

Both CLIs work identically and accept the same commands and arguments.
To run a TKGI CLI command,
substitute `tkgi` where you previously used `pks`.
For more information, see [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> CLI](./cli/index.html).

To download the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> CLI or the PKS CLI, see
[<%= vars.product_network %>](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-container-service/).

#### <a id="1-8-0-vsphere"></a>vSphere v7 Compatibility

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.8 can run on vSphere v7.

#### <a id="1-8-0-nsxt-compat"></a>NSX-T v3.0 Compatibility

On vSphere, <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> can run with NSX-T v3.0 container networking.

<p class="note warning">
<strong>Warning:</strong> <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> supports NSX-T v3.0 as a beta integration. 
Intermittent upgrade failures and scale problems may occur if you upgrade to NSX-T v3.0. 
Upgrading your NSX-T environment to v3.0 in a production or large-scale deployment is not recommended 
until a patch resolving these issues has been released.
</p>


#### <a id="1-8-0-tkgi-core"></a><%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Control Plane and API

* The <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> API VM no longer stores a copy of the
control plane database that the v1.7 upgrade migrated to the Database VM.
This deletion frees internal memory in the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> API VM.
As a result, users may notice improved control plane performance.

* The **PKS 1.7.x Upgrade - MySQL Clone errand** errand has been removed from the
<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> tile **Errands** pane.


#### <a id="1-8-0-bosh-lifecycle"></a>Kubernetes Control Plane

* On Azure, <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> supports disabling the creation of a default outbound SNAT rule for clusters.
See [Kubernetes Cloud Provider](installing-azure.html#cloud-provider) 
for how to disable the default SNAT rule.

#### <a id="1-8-0-logging-monitoring"></a><%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Monitoring and Logging

* All <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> components use TLS v1.2 with
strong ciphers, including the `metrics-server` component.
`sslscan` on a `metrics-server` over port `443` now reports only TLS v1.2+
ciphers.

#### <a id="1-8-0-telemetry"></a>Customer Experience Improvement Program (CEIP) and Telemetry

* The legacy Telemetry DB has been removed from the <%= vars.control_plane_db %>. 

#### <a id="1-8-0-component-updates"></a>Component Updates

The following components have been updated:

* Bumps Kubernetes to v1.17.5.
* Bumps NCP to v3.0.1.
* Bumps UAA to v74.5.15.

###<a id="1-8-0-bug-fixes"></a>Bug Fixes

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.8.0 includes the following bug fixes:

* `tkgi tasks` returns valid output for all clusters.
* `tkgi upgrade-cluster` errand no longer times out when stopping `dockerd` processes.
* `tkgi get-credentials` works for clusters that have not been upgraded.
* `tkgi update-cluster` retains the `compute_profile` value when changing settings
for clusters created with a Compute Profile.


###<a id='1-8-0-known-issues'></a>Known Issues

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.8.0 has the following known issues:

#### <a id='1-8-0-xenial-compat'></a><%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.8 With NSX-T v3.0 Not Compatible With Xenial Stemcells 621.76+ and Ops Manager v2.9.6

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> with NSX-T v3.0 is compatible with Linux Ubuntu Xenial stemcell v621.75, but not with stemcell versions v621.76 and later.

Because Ops Manager v2.9.6 uses Xenial stemcell 621.76, <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.8
with NSX-T on vSphere is incompatible with that version.
<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.8 on NSX-T is compatible with Ops Manager v2.9.3 - v2.9.5.

#### <a id='1-8-0-cvds'></a>VCF 4 and Converged VDS v7 Not Supported in <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.8

For installations on vSphere v7 with NSX-T v3.0 integration,
<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.8 supports only N-VDS for NSX-T traffic.
It does not support:

* Converged Virtual Distributed
Switch (C-VDS) v7, which lets you use the same VDS for both vSphere and NSX-T traffic
* VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) v4.x, which uses only VDS mode with
NSX-T v3.0

For more information, see
[Configure vSphere Networking for ESXi Hosts](nsxt-3-0-install.html#nsxt30-esxi-vswitch)
in _Installing and Configuring NSX-T Data Center v3.0 for <%= vars.product_short %>_.

#### <a id='1-8-0-ops-manager'></a><%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.8 (Windows) on vSphere Not Compatible with Ops Manager v2.9

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.8 installations with Windows worker-based
Kubernetes clusters on vSphere (Flannel)
are not compatible with Ops Manager v2.9.
If you do not intend to deploy and run Windows worker-based Kubernetes clusters,
you can use Ops Manager v2.9 with <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.8.

For Ops Manager compatibility information,
see [<%= vars.product_network %>](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-container-service).

#### <a id='1-8-0-ping'></a>Pinging Windows Workers Does Not Work

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>-provisioned Windows workers inherit a Kubernetes limitation that prevents
outbound ICMP communication from workers.
As a result, pinging Windows workers does not work.

For information about this limitation, see [Limitations > Networking](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/windows/intro-windows-in-kubernetes/#networking-1)
in the _Windows in Kubernetes_ documentation.

#### <a id="1-8-0-tmc-on-gcp"></a>TMC Integration Not Supported on GCP

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) does not support
Tanzu Mission Control integration, which is configured in
the **<%= vars.product_tile %>** tile > the **Tanzu Mission Control (Experimental)** pane.

If you intend to run <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.8 on GCP,
skip this pane when configuring the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile.

#### <a id="1-8-0-oidc-response-header"></a>502 Bad Gateway After OIDC Login  

**Symptom**  

You experience a "502 Bad Gateway" error from the NSX load balancer after you log in to OIDC.  

**Explanation**  

A large response header has exceeded your NSX-T load balancer maximum 
response header size. The default maximum response header size is 10,240 characters and should 
be resized to 50,000.  

**Workaround**  

If you experience this issue, manually reconfigure your NSX-T `request_header_size` 
and `response_header_size` to 50,000 characters. 
For information about configuring NSX-T default header sizes, 
see [OIDC Response Header Overflow](https://community.pivotal.io/s/article/OIDC-Response-Header-overflow) in the Knowledge Base.  

#### <a id='1-8-0-uuid-length'></a> One Plan ID Longer than Other Plan IDs  

**Symptom**  

One of your plan IDs is one character longer than your other plan IDs.  

**Explanation**  

In <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>, each plan has a unique plan ID.
A plan ID is normally a UUID consisting of 32 alphanumeric characters and 4 hyphens. 
However, the **Plan 4** ID consists of 33 alphanumeric characters and 4 hyphens.  

**Solution**  

You can safely configure and use **Plan 4**. 
The length of the **Plan 4** ID does not affect the functionality of **Plan 4** clusters.  

If you require all plan IDs to have identical length, do not activate or use **Plan 4**.  

#### <a id='1-8-0-eight-cores-error'></a> NSX-T Pre-Check Errand Fails Due to Edge Node Configuration  

**Symptom**  

You have configured your NSX-T Edge Node VM as `medium` size, 
and the NSX-T Pre-Check Errand fails with the following error: 
"_ERROR: NSX-T Precheck failed due to Edge Node ... no of cpu cores is less than 8_". 

**Explanation**  

The NSX-T Pre-Check Errand is erroneously returning the "_cpu cores is less than 8_" error.

**Solution**  

You can safely configure your NSX-T Edge Node VMs as `medium` size and ignore the error. 

#### <a id='1-8-0-windows-proxy'></a> Difficulty Changing Proxy for Windows Workers

You must configure a global proxy in the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile > **Networking** pane before you create any Windows workers that use the proxy.

You cannot change the proxy configuration for Windows workers in an existing cluster.

#### <a id='1-8-0-http-proxy-password'></a> Character Limitations in HTTP Proxy Password

For vSphere with NSX-T, the HTTP Proxy password field does not support the following special characters: `&` or `;`.

### <a id='management-console-1-8-0-upgrade'></a>Upgrade Path

The supported upgrade path to <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console v1.8.0 is from 
<%= vars.product_short %> v1.7.0 and later.

### <a id="management-console-1.8.0-known-issues"></a> Known Issues

The <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console v1.8.0 has the following known issues:

#### <a id="management-console-1.8.0-vrli-https"></a> vRealize Log Insight integration does not support HTTPS connections

**Symptom**

The <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console integration to vRealize Log Insight does not support connections to the HTTPs port on the vRealize Log Insight server. 

**Workaround**

1. Use SSH to log in to the <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console appliance VM.
1. Open the file `/lib/systemd/system/pks-loginsight.service` in a text editor.
1. Add `-e LOG_SERVER_ENABLE_SSL_VERIFY=false`  
1. Set `-e LOG_SERVER_USE_SSL=true`. 
   
    The resulting file should look like the following example:
       
    ```
    ExecStart=/bin/docker run --privileged --restart=always --network=pks 
    -v /var/log/journal:/var/log/journal 
    --name=pks-loginsight 
    -e TYPE=gear2-vm 
    -e LOG_SERVER_HOST=${LOGINSIGHT_HOST} 
    -e LOG_SERVER_PORT=${LOGINSIGHT_PORT} 
    -e LOG_SERVER_ENABLE_SSL_VERIFY=false 
    -e LOG_SERVER_USE_SSL=true 
    -e LOG_SERVER_AGENT_ID=${LOGINSIGHT_ID} 
    pksoctopus/vrli-journald:v07092019
    ```      
   
1. Save the file and run `systemctl daemon-reload`.
1. Run `systemctl restart pks-loginsight.service` to restart the vRealize Log Insight service.
 
<%= vars.product_short %> Management Console can now send logs to the HTTPS port on the vRealize Log Insight server.

#### <a id="management-console-1.8.0-vsphere-ha"></a> vSphere HA causes Management Console ovfenv Data Corruption

**Symptom**

If you enable vSphere HA on a cluster, if the TKGI Management Console appliance VM is running on a host in that cluster, and if the host reboots, vSphere HA recreates a new TKGI Management Console appliance VM on another host in the cluster. Due to an issue with vSphere HA, the `ovfenv` data for the newly created appliance VM is corrupted and the new appliance VM does not boot up with the correct network configuration. 

**Workaround**

- In the vSphere Client, right-click the appliance VM and select **Power** > **Shut Down Guest OS**.
- Right-click the appliance again and select Edit Settings.
- Select **VM Options** and click **OK**.
- Verify under Recent Tasks that a `Reconfigure virtual machine` task has run on the appliance VM.
- Power on the appliance VM.

#### <a id="management-console-1.8.0-k8s-profile"></a> Base64 encoded file arguments are not decoded in Kubernetes profiles

**Symptom**

Some file arguments in Kubernetes profiles are base64 encoded. When the management console displays the Kubernetes profile,
some file arguments are not decoded.

**Workaround**

Run `echo "$content" | base64 --decode` 

#### <a id="management-console-1.8.0-network-profile"></a> Network profiles not immediately selectable

**Symptom**

If you create network profiles and then try to apply them in the Create Cluster page, the new profiles 
are not available for selection. 

**Workaround**

Log out of the management console and log back in again.

#### <a id="management-console-1.8.0-cluster-summary"></a> Real-Time IP information not displayed for network profiles

**Symptom**

In the cluster summary page, only default IP pool, pod IP block, node IP block values are displayed, 
rather than the real-time values from the associated network profile. 

**Workaround**

None
