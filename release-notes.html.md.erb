#### <a id="1-11-4-bosh-vm-not-starting"></a> The BOSH VM in Clusters Using the Integrated vSphere CSI Driver Might Enter a Failing State While Rebooting

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.11.5](#1-11-5-bug-fixes).

**Symptom**

As you restart a BOSH worker VM in a cluster that uses the integrated vSphere CSI Driver, the VM might enter a `failing` state.

**Explanation**

The `csi-node` process on the BOSH worker VM is running but is in an `Execution failed` state.   

**Workaround**

To return the BOSH VM to a running state, restart the `csi-node` process:  

1. Determine which BOSH VM is in the failing state.  
1. SSH into the failed BOSH VM.  
1. Run:  

    ```
    monit restart csi-node
    ```

#### <a id="1-11-3-node-exporeter-not-upgraded"></a> The Node Exporter is Not Upgraded during a Cluster Upgrade

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.11.5](#1-11-5-bug-fixes).

**Symptom**

After you upgrade a cluster to <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.11.3, the original worker nodes on the cluster have
`epks-docker-local.artifactory.eng.vmware.com/oratos/node-exporter` and `gcr.io/cf-pks-releng-environments/oratos/` node-exporter images. 
If you resize the cluster to have additional worker nodes, the new nodes are created with only the 
`gcr.io/cf-pks-releng-environments/oratos/` node-exporter image.  

**Explanation**

The worker node Node Exporter is not upgraded in <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.11.3 because 
the reduced permissions on the observability manager ClusterRole prevent patching daemonset.  

<hr>

#### <a id="1-11-3-incorrect-worker-count"></a> `tkgi clusters` Returns the Incorrect Number of Worker Instances


This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.11.5](#1-11-5-bug-fixes).

**Symptom**

The `tkgi clusters --json` command returns an incorrect `kubernetes_worker_instances` worker instance count 
for clusters configured using a Compute Profile.

#### <a id="1-11-2-drain-cluster-windows-errand-does-not-exist"></a> "drain-cluster-windows" Errand Does Not Exist 


This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.11.3](#1-11-3-bug-fixes).

**Symptom**

When you delete a Linux cluster, the `drain-cluster-windows` errand reports the following error:

```
Errand 'drain-cluster-windows' doesn't exist
```

**Explanation**

When you delete a cluster, the following errands run:

* `drain-cluster`
* `drain-cluster-windows`

Both errands run regardless of whether the cluster is a Linux or Windows cluster.

On a Linux cluster, the Windows cluster and the `drain-cluster-windows` errand do not exist. The log shows the following:

```
Task 572
Task 572 | 11:39:54 | Preparing deployment: Preparing deployment
Task 572 | 11:39:54 | Deprecation: Global 'properties' are deprecated. Please define 'properties' at the job level.
Task 572 | 11:39:56 | Preparing deployment: Preparing deployment (00:00:02)
 L Error: Errand 'drain-cluster-windows' doesn't exist
Task 572 | 11:39:56 | Error: Errand 'drain-cluster-windows' doesn't exist
Task 572 Started Tue Jun 29 11:39:54 UTC 2021
Task 572 Finished Tue Jun 29 11:39:56 UTC 2021
Task 572 Duration 00:00:02
Task 572 error
```

On a Windows cluster, both the `drain-cluster` and `drain-cluster-windows` errands exist, and no
error messages are generated.

**Workaround**

No workaround is necessary. The error message is informational, accurate, and does not negatively
impact deleting the cluster.

#### <a id="1-11-2-hyperbus-error"></a> Kubernetes Pods on NSX-T Become Stuck in a Creating State 

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.11.4](#1-11-4-bug-fixes).

**Symptom**

During an NSX-T upgrade or while increasing the number of ESXi nodes in your NSX-T environment, 
the pods in your <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Kubernetes clusters become stuck in a creating state. 
The connections between nsx-node-agent and hyperbus repeatedly close, 
log `Couldn't connect to 'tcp://...' (error: 111-Connection refused)`, and have a status of `COMMUNICATION_ERROR`.  

**Explanation**

For information and workaround steps for this Known Issue, see 
[Issue 2795268: Connection between nsx-node-agent and hyperbus flips and Kubernetes pod is stuck at creating state](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center/3.1/rn/NSX-Container-Plugin-312-Release-Notes.html#RNA_11559) 
in _NSX Container Plugin 3.1.2 Release Notes_ in the VMware documentation.

#### <a id="1-11-2-backend-pool-error"></a> Worker Nodes Are Occasionally Not Added to an Azure Back-End Pool 

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.11.4](#1-11-4-bug-fixes).

**Symptom**

The Kubernetes services of type `LoadBalancer` occasionally become inaccessible for a few of your clusters while recreating clusters on Azure. 
On the few affected clusters, 
the newly recreated worker VMs were not added back to the load balancer back-end pools used by type `LoadBalancer` services.  

**Explanation**

For information on this known Kubernetes issue, see 
[Azure Exclude node from LoadBalancer lead to failed reconciliation of services](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/103085) 
in the Kubernetes GitHub repository.

### <a id="1-11-0-breaking-changes"></a> Breaking Changes

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.11.0 has the following breaking changes:

* Fluent Bit has been upgraded to Fluent Bit v1.5.7:  

    * Previous versions of <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> have used Fluent Bit v1.3.4. 
    For information on the differences between the Fluent Bit v1.3.4 and v1.5.7 releases, see 
    [Upgrade Notes](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/installation/upgrade-notes) in the Fluent Bit documentation.  

    * By default, Fluent Bit v1.5.7 limits the size of Kubernetes log metadata to 32&nbsp;KB. 
    For more information, see [Some Kubernetes Logs Are Not Forwarded after Upgrading](#1-11-0-logs-not-forwarded) 
    in the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.11.0 Known Issues below.

* The built-in Clair container image scanner is deprecated in favor of Trivy. If you have enabled Clair, do one of the following before upgrading to Harbor tile v2.2.1:
    * In the Harbor tile, select the Trivy scanner as the default in "Interrogation Service".  
    * Install the Clair scanner outside the Harbor tile VM and configure the Clair scanner as the default scanner in "Interrogation Service". For more information about installing Clair, see
[Getting Started With Clair](https://github.com/quay/clair/blob/main/Documentation/howto/getting_started.md)
in the Clair documentation. For information about upgrading TKGI with Clair enabled, see

### <a id="1-11-0-features"></a>Features

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.11.0 has the following features and enhancements:

#### <a id="1-11-0-automatic-cns"></a>Support for Per-Cluster CA and Custom CA

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.11 updates the security of the platform by removing the shared cluster CA and introducing a per-cluster CA. By default a new or updated cluster is given its own unique CA that is used to sign the TLS certificates specific to that cluster. No action is needed to take advantage of the per-cluster CA; it is injected automatically for any Kubernetes cluster provisioned by <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.11 and later. For more information, see [TKGI Certificates](certificate-concepts.html).

A byproduct of the introduction of the per-cluster CA is that you can now use a custom CA when you create a cluster. While this is an advanced use case, it may be appropriate for some customers with specific security requirements. See [Use a Custom CA for Kubernetes Clusters](custom-ca.html) and [Creating Clusters](create-cluster.html) for more information.

#### <a id="1-11-0-automatic-cns"></a>Automatic vSphere CSI Driver Integration

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.11.0 supports automatic vSphere CSI Driver installation on vSphere. 
Automatic vSphere CSI Driver integration provides CNS as a process, allowing CNS volumes to be deployed to clusters without requiring access to IaaS credentials. 
For more information, see [Deploying Cloud Native Storage (CNS) on vSphere](vsphere-cns.html).  

#### <a id="1-11-0-add-dns"></a>Add DNS Server IPs to Clusters Using Network Profiles 
Supports using Network Profiles to add additional DNS server IPs to existing clusters. 
For information about using a Network Profile to update a cluster with additional DNS server IPs, see [Confirm the Network Profile Property Supports Updates](network-profiles-define.html#supports-updates) 
in _Creating and Deleting Network Profiles (NSX-T Only)_.  

#### <a id="1-11-0-host-port"></a>Kubernetes Host Port Support

Supports the Kubernetes Host Port feature. 
The Kubernetes Host Port feature allows you to expose an application to be externally accessible through a single port. 
Host Port support requires a Host Port-compatible CNI. Host Port support does not require privileged mode. 
For more information, see [Creating and Deleting Network Profiles (NSX-T Only)](network-profiles-define.html).  

#### <a id="1-11-0-node-local-cache"></a>Supports Kubernetes NodeLocal DNSCache

Supports enabling the NCP 3.1 Kubernetes NodeLocal DNSCache feature. 
NodeLocal DNSCache improves cluster DNS performance by running a DNS caching agent on cluster nodes. The agent runs on the nodes as a DaemonSet. 
For more information, see [Creating and Deleting Network Profiles (NSX-T Only)](network-profiles-define.html).  

#### <a id="1-11-0-coredns-highly-available"></a>CoreDNS is Highly Available

CoreDNS in <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.11.0 and later is highly available. 
CoreDNS functions in multi-node Pods are automatically distributed across Pods across your designated AZs. 
CoreDNS in an existing <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> multi-node Pod is automatically reconfigured for high availability when the cluster is upgraded 
to <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.11.   

#### <a id="1-11-0-vm-extensions"></a>Support for BOSH VM&nbsp;Extensions

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.11.0 supports configuring new and existing <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>-provisioned 
Kubernetes clusters using BOSH VM&nbsp;Extensions. 
For more information, see [Using BOSH VM&nbsp;Extensions](bosh-vm-extensions.html).  

#### <a id="1-11-0-bitfusion-interoperability"></a>VMware vSphere Bitfusion Interoperability

VMware vSphere Bitfusion supports <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.11.0.

Bitfusion decouples physical resources from servers within an environment. The Bitfusion platform
can share graphical processing units (GPUs) in a virtualized infrastructure, as a pool of
network-accessible resources, rather than isolated resources per server. Bitfusion works across
AI frameworks, clouds, networks, and in environments such as virtual machines and containers.

For information about integrating your <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> clusters with Bitfusion, see the 
[VMware Kubernetes Integration with Bitfusion](https://www.vmware.com/content/dam/digitalmarketing/vmware/en/pdf/solutions/vmw-kubernetes-bitfusion-integration.pdf) 
solutions guide. 
For information about Bitfusion, see the
[VMware vSphere Bitfusion Documentation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere-Bitfusion/index.html).  

#### <a id="1-11-0-enhancements"></a>Additional Features
<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.11.0 includes the following additional features:  

* Returns an error if a network profile configuration changes a parameter that does not support 
modification.
* Supports integration with Tanzu Mission Control. For more information about Tanzu Mission Control, see the [Tanzu Mission control](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Mission-Control/) documentation.

#### <a id="1-11-0-runc-node-notready"></a> Nodes with More Than 30 Stateful Pods Are in a NotReady State

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.11.1](#1-11-1-bug-fixes).

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> If you have nodes with more than 30 stateful Pods 
    or nodes with a total of more than 50 Pods, do not upgrade to <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.11.0.
</p>

**Symptom**  

Nodes that have more than 50 Pods or more than 30 stateful Pods are in a `NotReady` state, 
and you see the following errors in kubelet logs:

```
Error syncing pod ... skipping: rpc error: code = DeadlineExceeded desc = context deadline exceeded
skipping pod synchronization - PLEG is not healthy: pleg was last seen active...
skipping pod synchronization - PLEG is not healthy: pleg was last seen active...
failed to collect filesystem stats - rootDiskErr: could not stat .. to get inode usage: stat ...: no such file or directory, extraDiskErr: could not stat
```

**Explanation**

The runc component has introduced instability into nodes consisting of 50 or more Pods or 30 or more statefulset Pods. 
For more information, see [loading seccomp filter: invalid argument](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/issues/2865)

#### <a id="1-11-0-nsxt-302-310"></a> Pods Stop After Upgrading From NSX-T v3.0.2 to v3.1.0 on vSphere 7.0 and 7.0.1

**Symptom**

Your TKGI-provisioned Pods stop after upgrading from NSX-T v3.0.2 to NSX-T v3.1.0 on vSphere 7.0 and 7.0.1.

**Explanation**

For information, see [Issue 2603550: Some VMs are vMotioned and lose network connectivity during UA nodes upgrade]
(https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center/3.1/rn/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center-311-Release-Notes.html#2603550) in the _VMware NSX-T Data Center 3.1.1 Release Notes_.

**Workaround**

To avoid the loss of network connectivity during UA node upgrade, ensure DRS is set to manual mode during your upgrade from NSX-T v3.0.2 to v3.1.0.

If you upgraded to NSX-T v3.1.0 with DRS in automation mode, run the following on the affected Pods' master VMs to restore Pod connectivity:

```
monit restart ncp
```

For more information about upgrading NSX-T v3.0.2 to NSX-T v3.1.0, see [Upgrade NSX-T Data Center to v3.0 or v3.1](upgrade-nsxt.html#upgrade-nsxt).

```

**Explanation**

The Azure CPI endpoint used by Ops Manager has been changed and
your installed version of Ops Manager is not compatible with the new endpoint.

**Workaround**

Run the following Ops Manager CLI command:

```
om --skip-ssl-validation --username USERNAME --password PASSWORD --target https://OPSMAN-API curl --silent --path /api/v0/staged/director/verifiers/install_time/IaasConfigurationVerifier -x PUT -d '{ "enabled": false }'
```

Where:

* `USERNAME` is the account to use to run Ops Manager API commands.
* `PASSWORD` is the password for the account.
* `OPSMAN-API` is the IP address for the Ops Manager API

#### <a id="1-11-0-in-windows-notready-nodes"></a> Windows Cluster Nodes Not Deleted After VM Deleted

**Symptom**

After you delete a VM using the management console of your infrastructure provider, you notice a Windows worker node
that had been on that VM is now in a `notReady` state.

**Solution**

1. To identify the leftover node:

    ```
    kubectl get no -o wide
    ```
1. Locate nodes on the returned list that are in a `notReady` state and have the same IP address as another node in the list.
1. To manually delete a `notReady` node:

    ```
    kubectl delete node NODE-NAME
    ```
    Where `NODE-NAME` is the name of the node in the `notReady` state.

#### <a id="1-11-0-oidc-response-header"></a>502 Bad Gateway After OIDC Login

**Symptom**

You experience a "502 Bad Gateway" error from the NSX load balancer after you log in to OIDC.

**Explanation**

A large response header has exceeded your NSX-T load balancer maximum
response header size. The default maximum response header size is 10,240 characters and should
be resized to 50,000.

**Workaround**

If you experience this issue, manually reconfigure your NSX-T `request_header_size`
and `response_header_size` to 50,000 characters.
For information about configuring NSX-T default header sizes,

#### <a id='1-11-0-resizing-worker-nodes'></a> Ingress Controller Statefulset Fails to Start After Resizing Worker Nodes

**Symptom**  

Permissions are removed from your cluster’s files and processes after resizing the persistent disk 
during a cluster upgrade. The ingress controller statefulset fails to start.

**Explanation**  

When resizing a persistent disk, Bosh migrates the data from the old disk to the new disk but 
does not copy the files’ extended attributes.

**Workaround**  

To resolve the problem, complete the steps in

#### <a id="1-11-0-security-group"></a>Azure Default Security Group Is Not Automatically Assigned to Cluster VMs

**Symptom**

You experience issues when configuring a load balancer for a multi-master Kubernetes cluster or creating a service of type `LoadBalancer`.
Additionally, in the Azure portal, the **VM** > **Networking** page does not display
any inbound and outbound traffic rules for your cluster VMs.

**Explanation**

As part of configuring the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile for Azure, you enter **Default Security Group** in the **Kubernetes Cloud Provider** pane.
When you create a Kubernetes cluster, <%= vars.product_short %> automatically assigns this security group to each VM in the cluster.
However, on Azure the automatic assignment may not occur.

As a result, your inbound and outbound traffic rules defined in the security group are not applied to the cluster VMs.

**Workaround**

If you experience this issue, manually assign the default security group to each VM NIC in your cluster.

#### <a id='1-11-0-uuid-length'></a> One Plan ID Longer than Other Plan IDs

**Symptom**

One of your plan IDs is one character longer than your other plan IDs.

**Explanation**

In <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>, each plan has a unique plan ID.
A plan ID is normally a UUID consisting of 32 alphanumeric characters and 4 hyphens.
However, the **Plan 4** ID consists of 33 alphanumeric characters and 4 hyphens.

**Solution**

You can safely configure and use **Plan 4**.
The length of the **Plan 4** ID does not affect the functionality of **Plan 4** clusters.

If you require all plan IDs to have identical length, do not activate or use **Plan 4**.

#### <a id='1-11-0-creating-two-windows-clusters-fails'></a> Creating Two Windows Clusters at the Same Time Fails

**Symptom**

The first time that you try to create two Windows clusters at the same time, the creation of one of
the clusters fails. If you run `pks cluster CLUSTER-NAME` to examine the last action taken on the
cluster, you see the following:

<pre class="terminal">

#### <a id='1-11-0-ncp-port-protocol-limit'></a> Cluster Fails to Restart

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.11.3](#1-11-3-bug-fixes).  

**Symptom**  

A stopped cluster fails to restart and you see the following error in the NSX Container Plug-in (NCP) logs:

```
Response body {'httpStatus': 'BAD_REQUEST', 'module_name': 'nsx-search', 'error_code': 60513, 'error_message': 'The result set is too large. Please refine the search criteria.'}

#### <a id='1-11-0-ncp-not-in-vrli'></a> You Cannot Use vRealize Log Insight to Monitor NCP

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.11.3](#1-11-3-bug-fixes). 

**Symptom**  

vRealize Log Insight (vRLI) monitoring does not include NCP stdout or stderror.  

**Explanation** 

A bug in the vRLI configuration prevents inclusion of NCP stdout and stderror in vRLI.

**Workaround**

To write NCP logs for a cluster to vRLI:  

1. Confirm you have admin access to the master node.
1. Open `/var/vcap/jobs/fluentd/config/config.d/nsx-t.conf`.
1. Replace:  

    ```
    expression /^(?<num>[\w]+) (?<time>[^ ]+) (?<nsx_uuid>[^ ]+) (?<nsx_component>[^ ]+) (?<pid>[^ ]+) - \[.* level="(?<severity>[^\"]+)".*\] (?<message>.+)/

#### <a id='1-11-0-fluentd-log-overflow'></a> The <%= vars.control_plane %> VM fluentd.stdout.log Grows While vRealize Log Insight is Disabled

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.11.2](#1-11-2-bug-fixes).  

**Symptom**  

While vRealize Log Insight (vRLI) is disabled, the log for `fluentd.stdout` on the <%= vars.control_plane %> VM
grows quite large and rolls over frequently.


**Explanation** 

The fluentd job on the <%= vars.control_plane %> VM automatically starts when vRLI is disabled. 
This fluentd job runs continuously, frequently writing inaccessible hostname errors to stdout 
for the non-existent vRLI endpoint. 
The fluentd stdout on the <%= vars.control_plane %> VM is logged in: 
`/var/vcap/sys/log/pks-vrli-control-plane-fluentd/fluentd.stdout.log`.


<hr>
#### <a id='1-11-0-invalid-gateway-from-subnet-range'></a> 'Invalid Gateway for Network' Error after Updating a Cluster with Both nodes_dns And IP Subnet Range Parameters

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.11.3](#1-11-3-bug-fixes).  

**Symptom**

After updating a cluster with a network profile that specifies a `nodes_dns` parameter 
and an IP subnet range other than the typical `x.x.x.x/24` range, for example, `1.1.1.64/26`, 
you see the following error for the updated cluster:

```
operation: update, error-message: Invalid gateway for network 'pks-...': must be inside the range
```

Subsequently, when you create or update a valid cluster, 
the process returns the same "_Invalid gateway for network_" error message.

 

**Explanation**

The error is reported because <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> has incorrectly updated the gateway IP to `x.x.x.1`, 
which is outside of your designated IP range.  

Additionally, BOSH validates all cloud-configs when creating deployments. 
The invalid cloud-config created by the error cluster blocks subsequent create and update cluster processes, 
including processes for valid clusters, and returns the same "_Invalid gateway for network_" error message.  

Avoid updating and resizing clusters with an IP subnet range other than `x.x.x.x/24`.  

For additional information, see 
[TKGI cluster update failing with error: “Invalid gateway for network 'xxx': must be inside the range” (85101)](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/85101) 
in the Knowledge Base.


**Workaround**

If you've already encountered this issue, delete the cluster with this error to avoid the subsequent BOSH issue.

 

To update an existing cluster:

* Remove the `nodes_dns` parameter from the network profile and update the cluster with the modified network profile.  

To create a new cluster, do one of the following:

* Create the cluster using a typical `x.x.x.x/24` IP subnet range.  
* Configure `nodes_dns` for the cluster through your <%= vars.product_tile %> tile configuration and 
remove the `nodes_dns` parameter from the network profile.



<hr>
#### <a id='1-11-0-dual-wavefront-collectors'></a> Wavefront Collector is Duplicated or Not Collecting from <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Namespaces

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.11.3](#1-11-3-bug-fixes).  

**Symptom**

After upgrading <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> to <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.10.0 or later, you observe that two Wavefront collectors are running instead of one. 
If one of the collectors stops, the remaining collector alternates between collecting metrics as itself and as the stopped collector. 
The `pks.kubernetes.daemonset.` and `pks.kubernetes.deployment.` namespaces may stop reporting.

**Explanation**

Two instances of Wavefront collector are currently installed and running: a v1.20 DaemonSet collector and a v1.26 Deployment collector. 
Both Wavefront collectors are running and collecting metrics. 
Only the v1.26 Deployment collector instance should be running. 

**Workaround**

You must remove the v1.20 DaemonSet Wavefront collector and leave the v1.26 Deployment collector running.

To remove the DaemonSet Wavefront collector:

1. Save the DaemonSet YAML creation file as `wf_daemonset.yaml`. 
Keep a copy of the file in case you need to restore the DaemonSet Wavefront collector.  

1. To delete the Wavefront Collector DaemonSet:

    ```
    kubectl delete daemonset wavefront-collector -n pks-system
    ```

If you later decide that you need to restore the DaemonSet collector, 
you can restore using the DaemonSet yaml creation file you saved earlier.

1. To restore the DaemonSet collector:

    ```
    kubectl apply -f wf_daemonset.yaml 
    kubetcl get daemonset/wavefront-collector -n pks-system -o yaml > wf_daemonset.yaml
    ```

#### <a id='1-11-0-tags-lost-during-update'></a> Tags Applied Using tkgi cli Commands Are Removed during `tkgi update-cluster` 

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.11.3](#1-11-3-bug-fixes).  

**Symptom**

The tags you applied to a cluster using the tkgi cli `--tags` parameter are removed whenever you run `tkgi update-cluster`.

**Workaround**

Specify the `--tags` parameter when updating a cluster using `tkgi update-cluster`:

1. To confirm the existing tags on a cluster:

    ```
    tkgi cluster CLUSTER-NAME
    ```

    Where `CLUSTER-NAME` is the name of the cluster to update.  
<br>
    Note the tags listed under `Tags:`.  

1. When running `tkgi update-cluster`, include the `--tags` parameter, specifying all of the existing tags on the cluster.

#### <a id='ops-man-1-x-certificates'></a> CA Certificates Initially Created by Ops Manager v1.8.3 and Earlier Are Not Supported

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.11.3](#1-11-3-bug-fixes).

**Symptom**

While upgrading <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> to <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.11.0, v1.11.1 or v1.11.2, you might observe the following error:

```
Config Server failed to generate value for '/microbosh-.../tls-kubernetes-2018' with type 'certificate'. HTTP Code '404', Error: 'The request could not be completed because the CA does not exist or you do not have sufficient authorization.'
```

**Explanation**

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.11.0, v1.11.1, and v1.11.2 do not support the CA Certificates named with the default `microbosh-` prefix applied to certificates by Ops Manager v1.8.3 and earlier.

but your <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> MC tabs include the following error: “…product ‘pivotal-container service’ is not deployed…”. 

**Explanation**

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> MC is associated with an Ops Manager with a specific name. 
If you rename Ops Manager with a new name while restoring,

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.11.4](#1-11-4-bug-fixes).

**Symptom**

Your Telegraf agents fail to read from localhost port 8080. 
Your cluster master node `/var/vcap/sys/log/metric-sink/telegraf.stderr.log` 
files contain logged errors similar to the following:

```
Error in plugin: error making HTTP request to http://localhost:8080/metrics: Get http://localhost:8080/metrics: dial tcp 127.0.0.1:8080: connect: connection refused

<%#This issue is fixed in [< %= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr % > v1.11.5](#1-11-5-bug-fixes).  #%>
**Symptom**

After you uninstall <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>, then reinstall <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> in the same environment, 
BOSH Director logs errors similar to the following:  

```
.../gems/bosh-director-0.0.0/lib/bosh/director/deployment_plan/cloud_manifest_parser.rb:120:in `parse_vm_extensions': Duplicate vm extension name 'disk_enable_uuid' (Bosh::Director::DeploymentDuplicateVmExtensionName)
```

**Explanation**

The `pivotal-container-service` cloud-config was not removed when you uninstalled the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> tile, 
and it remained active.
When you reinstalled the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> tile, an additional `pivotal-container-service` cloud-config was created, 
causing the metrics_server to fall into a crash-loop state.  

**Workaround**

You must manually remove the `pivotal-container-service` cloud-config after removing your <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> deployment, 
including after removing the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> tile from Ops Manager.

#### <a id="1-11-0-azure-hostnames-not-resolved"></a> Node Hostnames Are Not Resolved for BYO DNS in Azure Environments

**Symptom**

If you use a bring-your-own DNS configuration in Azure environments, 
node hostnames are not resolved on your <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> clusters, and kubectl returns a "no such host" error:

```
Error from server: Get "...": dial tcp: lookup ... on ... no such host
```

**Explanation**

On Azure, the Azure CPI uses BOSH `agent_id` GUIDs as the VM name. 
Additionally, the Azure Kubernetes cloud provider mandates the VM name matches the hostname 
and that the hostname is resolvable without using search domains.

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> on Azure relies on Dynamic DNS updates via DHCP to allow resolvable K8s node names. 
Environments with a bring-your-own DNS server configuration must provide an alternative method 
for updating DNS entries.

#### <a id="1-11-0-logs-not-forwarded"></a> Some Kubernetes Logs Are Not Forwarded after Upgrading

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.11.5](#1-11-5-bug-fixes).  

**Symptom**

After you upgrade <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> to v1.11.0, some Kubernetes logs are no longer forwarded by Fluent Bit.

**Explanation**

In <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.11.0, Fluent Bit has been upgraded from v1.3.4 to v1.5.7. 
In Fluent Bit v1.5.7, the default Kubernetes annotation buffer size is 32&nbsp;KB, 
limiting the size of Kubernetes log metadata to 32&nbsp;KB by default. 
The Kubernetes log metadata in your environment exceeds this limit, and the log entries have been discarded.  

**Workaround**

To reduce the length of the Kubernetes metadata applied to your log entries, 
reduce the total size of the Kubernetes annotation environment variables you have defined in your environment.

#### <a id="management-console-1-11-0-vrli-https"></a> vRealize Log Insight Integration Does Not Support HTTPS Connections

**Symptom**

The <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console integration to vRealize Log Insight does not support connections to the HTTPS port on the vRealize Log Insight server.

**Workaround**

1. Use SSH to log in to the <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console appliance VM.
1. Open the file `/lib/systemd/system/pks-loginsight.service` in a text editor.
1. Add `-e LOG_SERVER_ENABLE_SSL_VERIFY=false`.
1. Set `-e LOG_SERVER_USE_SSL=true`.

    The resulting file should look like the following example:

    ```
    ExecStart=/bin/docker run --privileged --restart=always --network=pks
    -v /var/log/journal:/var/log/journal
    --name=pks-loginsight
    -e TYPE=gear2-vm
    -e LOG_SERVER_HOST=${LOGINSIGHT_HOST}
    -e LOG_SERVER_PORT=${LOGINSIGHT_PORT}
    -e LOG_SERVER_ENABLE_SSL_VERIFY=false
    -e LOG_SERVER_USE_SSL=true
    -e LOG_SERVER_AGENT_ID=${LOGINSIGHT_ID}
    pksoctopus/vrli-journald:v07092019
    ```

1. Save the file and run `systemctl daemon-reload`.
1. To restart the vRealize Log Insight service, run `systemctl restart pks-loginsight.service`.

<%= vars.product_short %> Management Console can now send logs to the HTTPS port on the vRealize Log Insight server.

#### <a id="management-console-1-11-0-vsphere-ha"></a> vSphere HA causes Management Console ovfenv Data Corruption

**Symptom**

If you enable vSphere HA on a cluster, if the TKGI Management Console appliance VM is running on a host in that cluster, and if the host reboots, vSphere HA recreates a new TKGI Management Console appliance VM on another host in the cluster. Due to an issue with vSphere HA, the `ovfenv` data for the newly created appliance VM is corrupted and the new appliance VM does not boot up with the correct network configuration.

**Workaround**

- In the vSphere Client, right-click the appliance VM and select **Power** > **Shut Down Guest OS**.
- Right-click the appliance again and select Edit Settings.
- Select **VM Options** and click **OK**.
- Verify under Recent Tasks that a `Reconfigure virtual machine` task has run on the appliance VM.
- Power on the appliance VM.

<hr>
#### <a id="management-console-1-11-0-k8s-profile"></a> Base64 encoded file arguments are not decoded in Kubernetes profiles

**Symptom**

Some file arguments in Kubernetes profiles are base64 encoded. When the management console displays the Kubernetes profile,
some file arguments are not decoded.

**Workaround**

Run `echo "$content" | base64 --decode`

<hr>
#### <a id="management-console-1-11-0-network-profile"></a> Network profiles not immediately selectable

**Symptom**

If you create network profiles and then try to apply them in the Create Cluster page, the new profiles
are not available for selection.

**Workaround**

Log out of the management console and log back in again.

<hr>
#### <a id="management-console-1-11-0-cluster-summary"></a> Real-Time IP information not displayed for network profiles

**Symptom**

In the cluster summary page, only default IP pool, pod IP block, node IP block values are displayed,
rather than the real-time values from the associated network profile.

**Workaround**

None

<hr>
#### <a id='management-console-1-11-0-harbor-storage-config'></a> Error After Modifying Your Harbor Storage Configuration

**Symptom**

You receive the following error after modifying your existing Harbor installation's storage configuration:

```
Error response from daemon: manifest for ... not found: manifest unknown: manifest unknown
```

**Explanation**

Harbor does not support modifying an existing Harbor installation's storage configuration.

**Workaround**

To modify your Harbor storage configuration,
re-install Harbor. Before starting Harbor, configure the new Harbor installation with the desired configuration.

<hr>
#### <a id='management-console-1-11-0-re-import-windows-stemcell'></a> Windows Stemcells Must be Re-Imported After Upgrading Ops Manager

**Symptom**

After upgrading Ops Manager, your Management Console does not recognize a Windows stemcell imported when using the prior version of Ops Manager.

**Workaround**

If your Management Console does not recognize a Windows stemcell after upgrading Ops Manager:

1. Re-import your previously imported Windows stemcell.  
2. **Apply Changes** to <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> MC.  

<hr>
#### <a id='management-console-1-11-0-cluster-group-name'></a> Your New Clusters Are Not Shown In Tanzu Mission Control

**Symptom**

After you create a cluster, Tanzu Mission Control does not include the cluster in cluster lists. 
You have a "_Resource not found_" error similar to the following in your BOSH logs:

```
Cluster Name in TMC: cluster-1
Cluster Name Prefix: tkgi-my-prefix-
Group Name in TMC: my-prefix-clusters
Cluster Description in TMC: VMware Enterprise PKS Attaching cluster ''tkgi-my-prefix-cluster-1'' to TMC 
Fetching token successful 
request POST:/v1alpha1/clusters, 
response 404 Not Found:{"error":"Resource not found - clustergroup(my-prefix-clusters) 
org id(d859dc9f-g622-426d-8c91-939a9f13dea9)",
"code":5,"message":"Resource not found - clustergroup(my-prefix-clusters)
```

**Explanation**

The cluster group you assign a cluster to must be defined in Tanzu Mission Control 
before you assign your cluster to the cluster group in the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Management Console.

**Workaround**  

To resolve the problem, complete the steps in 
[Attaching a Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated (TKGI) cluster to Tanzu Mission Control (TMC) fails with "Resource not found - clustergroup(cluster-group-name)"](https://community.pivotal.io/s/article/tkgi-tmc-attach-fail) 
in the VMware Tanzu Knowledge Base.
