### <a id='1-8-1-upgrade'></a>Upgrade Path

The supported upgrade paths to <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.8.1 are from <%= vars.product_short %> v1.7.0 and later.

### <a id="1-8-1-features"></a>Features

This section describes new features and changes in <%= vars.product_short %> v1.8.1.

* Bumps Kubernetes to v1.17.8+vmware.1.
* Bumps NCP to v3.0.1.2.
  - Adds compatibility with NSX-T v3.0.1.1 (v3.0.1 EP1).  See [NSX-T v3.0 Compatibility](#1-8-0-nsxt-compat) below.
* **[Issue Fix]** NCP bump and NSX-T express patch remove [incompatibility with Xenial Stemcells 621.76+ and Ops Manager v2.9.6](#1-8-0-xenial-compat).
  - Because <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.8.0 is incompatible with 621.76+ stemcells, you must upgrade <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> to v1.8.1 and update all clusters before upgrading stemcells to 621.76+.
* **[Issue Fix]** NCP bump and NSX-T express patch [introduce beta support](#1-8-1-cvds) for VDS under specific conditions.
* **[Security Fix]** Kubernetes bump fixes the following CVEs:
  * [CVE-2020-8558](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/92315):
  node setting allows for neighboring hosts to bypass localhost boundary.
  * [CVE-2020-8559](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/92914):
  privilege escalation from compromised node to cluster.
* Support for vSphere v7.0 Virtual Distributed Switch (VDS). See [NSX-T support on VDS 7.0](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center/3.0/rn/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center-30-Release-Notes.html?hWord=N4IghgNiBcIM4HcCWAXAxgCwAQDclwFdIkAvMFJAewDsQBfIA#whats_new) in the NSX Data Center 3.0 Release Notes to learn more about NSX-T v3.0 integration with VDS v7 and the considerations for using VDS v7 for converged traffic. TKGI with VDS requirements:
  * Ops Manager v2.9.5 and later.
  * NSX-T v3.0.1.1 (v3.0.1 EP1) or later.
  * New installations of <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.8.1 and NSX-T 3.0.1.1. You cannot migrate existing NSX-T infrastructure for TKGI from N-VDS to VDS.
  * With a single VDS per TKGI instance, if you are installing TKGI using EPMC. Note that this limitation does not exist when TKGI is deployed with Ops Manager.

### <a id='1-8-0-upgrade'></a>Upgrade Path

The supported upgrade paths to <%= vars.product_short %> v1.8.0 are from <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.7.0 and later.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> <%= vars.recommended_by %> recommends upgrading to <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.8.1 or later, not upgrading to v1.8.0.</p>

### <a id="1-8-0-features"></a>Features

This section describes new features and changes in <%= vars.product_full %> v1.8.0.

#### <a id="1-8-0-rebranding"></a>Enterprise PKS Renamed to <%= vars.product_short %>

Enterprise PKS has been renamed to
<%= vars.product_short %> (<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>).

What has changed:

* The <%= vars.product_tile %> v1.8 tile uses the new name.
* <%= vars.product_short %> v1.8 includes
two downloads of the CLI, the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> CLI and PKS CLI.
See [PKS CLI Renamed  to <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> CLI](#1-8-0-tkgi-cli) below.

What has **not** changed:

* Internal components continue to use the old
name and its alternatives, such as `PKS`, `pks`, and `pivotal-container-service`.
This includes, but is not limited to, BOSH names, UAA roles, and text strings
containing the product name in <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> components
and <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>-provisioned clusters.

If you intend to continue using the PKS CLI in <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>
v1.8, no action is required.
However, future releases of <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> will deprecate and remove the PKS CLI.

#### <a id="1-8-0-tkgi-cli"></a>PKS CLI Renamed  to <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> CLI

To support the [product name change](#1-8-0-rebranding), <%= vars.product_short %> v1.8
is distributed with a <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> CLI in addition to a PKS CLI.

Both CLIs work identically and accept the same commands and arguments.
To run a TKGI CLI command,
substitute `tkgi` where you previously used `pks`.
For more information, see [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> CLI](./cli/index.html).

To download the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> CLI or the PKS CLI, see
[<%= vars.product_network %>](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-container-service/).

#### <a id="1-8-0-vsphere"></a>vSphere v7 Compatibility

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.8 can run on vSphere v7.

#### <a id="1-8-0-nsxt-compat"></a>NSX-T v3.0 Compatibility

On vSphere, <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> can run with NSX-T v3.0 container networking
with NSX-T v3.0.1.1 (v3.0.1 EP1) or later.

Upgrading <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> to NSX-T v3.0.1 requires you to apply the v3.0.1 EP1 Express Patch to the NSX-T upgrade.

<p class="note warning">
<strong>Warning:</strong> Intermittent upgrade failures and scale problems may occur if you upgrade to NSX-T v3.0.0, or upgrade to NSX-T v3.0.1 without applying the Express Patch.
</p>

#### <a id="1-8-0-tkgi-core"></a><%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Control Plane and API

* The <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> API VM no longer stores a copy of the
control plane database that the v1.7 upgrade migrated to the Database VM.
This deletion frees internal memory in the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> API VM.
As a result, users may notice improved control plane performance.

* The **PKS 1.7.x Upgrade - MySQL Clone errand** errand has been removed from the
**Errands** pane in the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> tile.

#### <a id="1-8-0-bosh-lifecycle"></a>Kubernetes Control Plane

* On Azure, <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> supports disabling the creation of a default outbound SNAT rule for clusters.
See [Kubernetes Cloud Provider](installing-azure.html#cloud-provider) 
for how to disable the default SNAT rule.

#### <a id="1-8-0-logging-monitoring"></a><%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Monitoring and Logging

* All <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> components use TLS v1.2 with
strong ciphers, including the `metrics-server` component.
`sslscan` on a `metrics-server` over port `443` now reports only TLS v1.2+
ciphers.

#### <a id="1-8-0-telemetry"></a>Customer Experience Improvement Program (CEIP) and Telemetry

* The legacy Telemetry DB has been removed from the <%= vars.control_plane_db %>. 

#### <a id="1-8-0-component-updates"></a>Component Updates

The following components have been updated:

* Bumps Kubernetes to v1.17.5.
* Bumps NCP to v3.0.1.
* Bumps UAA to v74.5.15.

###<a id="1-8-0-bug-fixes"></a>Bug Fixes

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.8.0 includes the following bug fixes:

* `tkgi tasks` returns valid output for all clusters.
* `tkgi upgrade-cluster` errand no longer times out when stopping `dockerd` processes.
* `tkgi get-credentials` works for clusters that have not been upgraded.
* `tkgi update-cluster` retains the `compute_profile` value when changing settings
for clusters created with a compute Profile.
* NSX-T Pre-Check Errand Fails Due to Edge Node CPU Count Configuration

###<a id='1-8-0-known-issues'></a>Known Issues

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.8.0 has the following known issues:

#### <a id="1-8-0-log4j-cve-2021-44228"></a> Apache Log4j Vulnerability CVE-2021-44228

Due to the Apache Log4j vulnerability [CVE-2021-44228](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228), 
VMware recommends that you take the following steps as soon as possible:

* Implement the workaround steps provided in [Workaround instructions to address CVE-2021-44228 in Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated](https://community.pivotal.io/s/article/Workaround-instructions-to-address-CVE-2021-44228-in-Tanzu-Kubernetes-Grid-Integrated?language=en_US)
in the VMware Tanzu Knowledge Base.   
* Upgrade to [Ops Manager v2.10.23](https://docs.pivotal.io/ops-manager/2-10/release-notes.html#2-10-23) or later.

#### <a id="1-8-0-upgrade-failure-from-large-billing-db"></a> Unable to Upgrade If the Billing Database Is Too Large

**Symptom**  

Upgrading <%= vars.product_short %> fails when the Billing DB is too large. 

**Explanation**  

The Billing DB is used for collecting and viewing usage data. The Billing feature is deprecated in <%= vars.product_short %> v1.9. 

**Workaround**

If you encounter an upgrade failure due to a large Billing DB, remove the Billing DB and proceed with the upgrade. 
To view usage data, you can use Telemetry instead of the Billing database.
For more information about the Billing database and Telemetry, see [Viewing Usage Data](view-usage-data.html#billing-db)
and [Telemetry](telemetry.html). 


#### <a id='1-8-0-stemcell-compat-2'></a> Kubernetes Clusters With Xenial Stemcell v621.85 and Later Fail After Upgrading <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> on vSphere With NSX-T to <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.8

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.8.3](#1-8-3-features).

**Symptom** 

After you upgrade to <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> on vSphere with NSX-T v1.8.0 and later, 
<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>-provisioned Kubernetes clusters with Xenial Stemcell v621.85 and later fail to start. 
The cluster start failure log includes the following:

```
Error: Action Failed get_task: Task ... result: Compiling package openvswitch: 
Running packaging script: Running packaging script: Command exited with 2;
```

Xenial Stemcell v621.85 is installed by default when installing Ops Manager v2.8.15.  

**Workaround**  

If you experience this issue, manually revert the stemcell to an earlier compatible version. 
For information about reverting stemcells, 
see [How to revert a stemcell in TKGI to prevent OVS compilation issues]
(https://pvtl.force.com/s/article/How-to-revert-stemcell-from-621-76-to-621-75-for-TKGI-1-8-0-to-prevent-ovs-compilation-issues?language=en_US) 
in the Knowledge Base.  


#### <a id="1-8-0-azure-apply-changes"></a> Error: Could Not Execute "Apply-Changes" in Azure Environment

**Symptom**  

After clicking **Apply Changes** on the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> tile in an Azure environment, you experience 
an error '_...could not execute "apply-changes"..._' with either of the following descriptions:

* _{"errors":{"base":["undefined method 'location' for nil:NilClass"]}}_  
* _FailedError.new("Resource Groups in region '#{location}' do not support Availability Zones"))_

For example:

**Explanation**  

The Azure CPI endpoint used by Ops Manager has been changed and 
your installed version of Ops Manager is not compatible with the new endpoint.

**Workaround**  

Run the following Ops Manager CLI command:

```
om --skip-ssl-validation --username USERNAME --password PASSWORD --target https://OPSMAN-API curl --silent --path /api/v0/staged/director/verifiers/install_time/IaasConfigurationVerifier -x PUT -d '{ "enabled": false }'
```

Where:

* `USERNAME` is the account to use to run Ops Manager API commands.  
* `PASSWORD` is the password for the account.  
* `OPSMAN-API` is the IP address for the Ops Manager API

#### <a id='1-8-0-upgrade-connectivity'></a>Loss of Network Connectivity While Upgrading Stateful Kubernetes Clusters

Stateful sets with attached persistent storage on <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> on vSphere with NSX-T 
might lose network connectivity while upgrading the set's Kubernetes clusters 
from <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.7 to <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.8. 
If a stateful set loses network connectivity, the set's workloads remain unavailable 
until all nodes of the cluster have been upgraded.  

#### <a id='1-8-0-restore-stateful-set'></a>After Restoring a Stateful Kubernetes Cluster a Pod in the Cluster Has the Status: ContainerCreating

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.8.3](#1-8-3-features).

**Symptom**  

After using Velero to restore a stateful set Kubernetes cluster, 
one of the Pods in the cluster has been restored to a `ContainerCreating` state instead of the expected `Running` state. 
Kubectl `describe` includes the following events for the Pod restored to the `ContainerCreating` state: "_Warning  FailedCreatePodSandBox... Failed to create pod sandbox: rpc error: code = Unknown desc = failed to set up sandbox container ...: networkPlugin cni failed to set up pod ... network: netplugin failed with no error message_".  

**Workaround**  

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.8.3](#1-8-3-features).

#### <a id='1-8-0-xenial-compat'></a><%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.8.0 With NSX-T v3.0 Not Compatible With Xenial Stemcells 621.76+ and Ops Manager v2.9.6

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.8.1](#1-8-1-features).

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> with NSX-T v3.0 is compatible with Linux Ubuntu Xenial stemcell v621.75, but not with stemcell versions v621.76 and later.

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.8.0 on vSphere with NSX-T is compatible with Ops Manager v2.9.3 - v2.9.5. 
<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.8.0 on vSphere with NSX-T is incompatible with 
Ops Manager v2.9.6 because that Ops Manager version uses Xenial stemcell v621.76.

#### <a id='1-8-0-cvds'></a>VCF 4 and VDS v7 Not Supported in <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.8.0

For installations on vSphere v7 with NSX-T v3.0 integration,
<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.8 supports only N-VDS for NSX-T traffic.
It does not support:

* VDS v7 using the same VDS for both vSphere and NSX-T traffic
* VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) v4.x, which uses only VDS mode with NSX-T v3.0

In <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.8.1, VDS support is beta [under certain conditions](#1-8-1-cvds).

For more information, see
[Configure vSphere Networking for ESXi Hosts](nsxt-3-0-install.html#nsxt30-esxi-vswitch)
in _Installing and Configuring NSX-T Data Center v3.0 for <%= vars.product_short %>_.

#### <a id='1-8-0-ops-manager'></a><%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.8 (Windows) on vSphere Not Compatible with Ops Manager v2.9

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.8 installations with Windows worker-based
Kubernetes clusters on vSphere (Flannel)
are not compatible with Ops Manager v2.9.
If you do not intend to deploy and run Windows worker-based Kubernetes clusters,
you can use Ops Manager v2.9 with <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.8.

For Ops Manager compatibility information,
see [<%= vars.product_network %>](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-container-service).

#### <a id='1-8-0-ping'></a>Pinging Windows Workers Does Not Work

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>-provisioned Windows workers inherit a Kubernetes limitation that prevents
outbound ICMP communication from workers.
As a result, pinging Windows workers does not work.

For information about this limitation, see [Limitations > Networking](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/windows/intro-windows-in-kubernetes/#networking-1)
in the _Windows in Kubernetes_ documentation.

#### <a id="1-8-0-tmc-on-gcp"></a>Tanzu Mission Control Integration Not Supported on GCP

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) does not support
Tanzu Mission Control (TMC) integration, which is configured in
the **<%= vars.product_tile %>** tile > the **Tanzu Mission Control (Experimental)** pane.

If you intend to run <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.8 on GCP,
skip this pane when configuring the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile.

#### <a id='1-8-0-tmc-api'></a>Existing <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Clusters No Longer Automatically Attach to TMC

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.8.3](#1-8-3-features).

**Symptom**  

Previously, your <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> clusters had attached to TMC automatically. 
Now, existing <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> clusters no longer automatically attach to TMC.  

**Explanation**  

The TMC API has been updated and is incompatible with the API calls from existing <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> clusters. 

**Workaround** 

Manually attach your existing <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> clusters to TMC. For more information, see 
[Attach an Existing Cluster](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Mission-Control/services/tanzumc-getstart/GUID-F0162E40-8D47-45D7-9EA1-83B64B380F5C.html) 
in the VMware Tanzu Mission Control Product Documentation.


#### <a id='1-8-0-tmc-restic'></a> TMC Data Protection Feature Requires Privileged <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Containers
The TMC Data Protection feature supports privileged <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> containers only. 
For more information, see [Plans](installing-vsphere.html#plans) in the _Installing TKGI_ topic for your IaaS.

#### <a id="1-8-0-oidc-response-header"></a>502 Bad Gateway After OIDC Login  

**Symptom**  

You experience a "502 Bad Gateway" error from the NSX load balancer after you log in to OIDC.  

**Explanation**  

A large response header has exceeded your NSX-T load balancer maximum 
response header size. The default maximum response header size is 10,240 characters and should 
be resized to 50,000.  

**Workaround**  

If you experience this issue, manually reconfigure your NSX-T `request_header_size` 
and `response_header_size` to 50,000 characters. 
For information about configuring NSX-T default header sizes, 
see [OIDC Response Header Overflow](https://community.pivotal.io/s/article/OIDC-Response-Header-overflow) in the Knowledge Base.  

#### <a id='1-8-0-uuid-length'></a> One Plan ID Longer than Other Plan IDs  

**Symptom**  

One of your plan IDs is one character longer than your other plan IDs.  

**Explanation**  

In <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>, each plan has a unique plan ID.
A plan ID is normally a UUID consisting of 32 alphanumeric characters and 4 hyphens. 
However, the **Plan 4** ID consists of 33 alphanumeric characters and 4 hyphens.  

**Solution**  

You can safely configure and use **Plan 4**. 
The length of the **Plan 4** ID does not affect the functionality of **Plan 4** clusters.  

If you require all plan IDs to have identical length, do not activate or use **Plan 4**.  

#### <a id='1-8-0-pre-check-hosts-onboarded'></a> NSX-T Pre-Check Errand Fails with Error: Unable to Check if ESXI Hosts are Onboarded  

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.8.3](#1-8-3-features).

**Symptom**  

When upgrading from <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.7.0 or later, the NSX-T Pre-Check Errand fails with the following error: 
"_ERROR: NSX-T Precheck failed due to Unable to check if esxi hosts are onboarded since hosts are empty_". 

**Explanation**  

The NSX-T Pre-Check Errand is unable to locate a relocated cluster.

**Solution**  

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.8.3](#1-8-3-features).

#### <a id='1-8-0-eight-cores-error'></a> NSX-T Pre-Check Errand Fails Due to Edge Node Configuration  

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.8.0](#1-8-0-features).

**Symptom**  

You have configured your NSX-T Edge Node VM as `medium` size, 
and the NSX-T Pre-Check Errand fails with the following error: 
"_ERROR: NSX-T Precheck failed due to Edge Node ... no of cpu cores is less than 8_". 

**Explanation**  

The NSX-T Pre-Check Errand is erroneously returning the "_cpu cores is less than 8_" error.

**Solution**  

You can safely configure your NSX-T Edge Node VMs as `medium` size and ignore the error. 

#### <a id='1-8-0-windows-proxy'></a> Difficulty Changing Proxy for Windows Workers

You must configure a global proxy in the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile > **Networking** pane before you create any Windows workers that use the proxy.

You cannot change the proxy configuration for Windows workers in an existing cluster.

#### <a id='1-8-0-http-proxy-password'></a> Character Limitations in HTTP Proxy Password

For vSphere with NSX-T, the HTTP Proxy password field does not support the following special characters: `&` or `;`.  


#### <a id='1-8-0-harbor-storage-config'></a> Error After Modifying Your Harbor Storage Configuration

**Symptom** 

You receive the following error after modifying your existing Harbor installation's storage configuration:  

```
Error response from daemon: manifest for ... not found: manifest unknown: manifest unknown
```
  
**Explanation**   

Harbor does not support modifying an existing Harbor installation's storage configuration.  

**Workaround**  

To modify your Harbor storage configuration, 
re-install Harbor. Before starting Harbor, configure the new Harbor installation with the desired configuration.  


#### <a id='1-8-0-cni0-mac-address'></a> Worker Node Kubelet Unable to Communicate with Master Node Kubernetes API after the cni0 Interface Changes Mac Address

This issue is fixed in [TKGI v1.9.3](https://docs.pivotal.io/tkgi/1-9/release-notes.html#1-9-3-features).

**Symptom**

On Flannel networks, worker node CNI0 interfaces may intermittently change MAC address, 
causing the worker nodes' kubelet to become unable to communicate with the master node Kubernetes API.

**Explanation**

A CNI bridge adopts the lowest MAC address of the attached veths. 
Adding a new container with a veth with a lower MAC address than any of the currently existing AC addresses 
results in changing the MAC address of cbr0, and the deletion of all of the existing connection 
tracking entries for the old MAC address. 
On Flannel networks this results in transient interruption of network traffic with the Pod.

**Workaround**

Complete the steps in [Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated (TKGI) / PKS Disable Docker Bridge]
(https://github.com/svrc/tkgi-disable-docker-bridge) in GitHub.

#### <a id='1-8-0-resizing-worker-nodes'></a> Ingress Controller Statefulset Fails to Start After Resizing Worker Nodes

**Symptom**  

Permissions are removed from your cluster’s files and processes after resizing the persistent disk 
during a cluster upgrade. The ingress controller statefulset fails to start.

**Explanation**  

When resizing a persistent disk, Bosh migrates the data from the old disk to the new disk but 
does not copy the files’ extended attributes.

**Workaround**  

To resolve the problem, complete the steps in 
[Ingress controller statefulset fails to start after resize of worker nodes with permission denied]
(https://community.pivotal.io/s/article/5000e00001nCJxT1603094435795?language=en_US)
in the VMware Tanzu Knowledge Base.

#### <a id='1-8-0-az-network-profile'></a> Network Profile Required with Compute Profile

**Symptom**  

When you create a cluster with a compute profile configured with an AZ setting, 
you must also configure the cluster with a network profile.

#### <a id='1-8-0-failed-upgrade'></a> <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Upgrade or Install Fails with Error "x509: certificate relies on legacy Common Name field" 

This issue is fixed in [TKGI v1.8.4](#1-8-4-features).

**Symptom**

Installing or upgrading <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> fails with the error:  

```
x509: certificate relies on legacy Common Name field, use SANs or temporarily enable Common Name matching with GODEBUG=x509ignoreCN=0
```

**Explanation**

Your NSX-T Root CA Certificate was generated without a Subject Alternate Name (SAN) and does not work with TKGI.
<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> VCF generates NSX-T Root CA Certificates without a SAN.
    Do not use VCF with <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.8.3.
</p>
<%#

#### <a id='1-8-0-k8s-race-condition'></a> Kubernetes Worker Nodes Run Out of Space 

**Symptom**

Your Kubernetes worker nodes slowly run out of disk space 
and your logs indicate Kubernetes has been attempting to access 
a directory that does not exist instead of an actual existing location:  

```
Failed to create existing container: ...: failed to identify the read-write layer ID for container "...". 
- open .../mount-id: no such file or directory
```

**Explanation**

cAdvisor has defaulted to default path settings due to a race condition between kubelet and Docker.


#### <a id='1-8-0-compute-profile-az-master'></a> You Cannot Change a Master Node's AZ

**Symptom**

Your existing master nodes return the error:
"_instance group 'master' must specify availability zone that matches availability zones of network_" after you 
modify the node's existing compute profile AZ or after attaching a compute profile configured with an AZ.  

**Explanation**

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> does not support changing an existing master node's AZ, 
either by modifying its cluster plan, modifying its cluster's attached compute profile, or attaching a new compute profile configured with an AZ.


#### <a id="1-8-0-security-group"></a>Azure Default Security Group Is Not Automatically Assigned to Cluster VMs

**Symptom**

You experience issues when configuring a load balancer for a multi-master Kubernetes cluster or creating a service of type `LoadBalancer`.
Additionally, in the Azure portal, the **VM** > **Networking** page does not display
any inbound and outbound traffic rules for your cluster VMs.

**Explanation**

As part of configuring the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile for Azure, you enter **Default Security Group** in the **Kubernetes Cloud Provider** pane.
When you create a Kubernetes cluster, <%= vars.product_short %> automatically assigns this security group to each VM in the cluster.
However, on Azure the automatic assignment may not occur.

As a result, your inbound and outbound traffic rules defined in the security group are not applied to the cluster VMs.

**Workaround**

If you experience this issue, manually assign the default security group to each VM NIC in your cluster.


#### <a id='1-8-0-uppercase-bosh-dns'></a> FQDNs in <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> API Commands Cannot Contain Uppercase Letters

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.10.1](#1-10-1-features).

**Symptom**

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> CLI commands fail with error:

```
Error: An error occurred in the PKS API when processing
```

**Explanation**

BOSH DNS, which <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> uses for its internal DNS, does not support uppercase letters in FQDNs.

**Workaround**

Use only lowercase letters in FQDNs that you assign to your <%= vars.control_plane %> VM in <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>. 


<%#
<%= vars.control_plane %     > logs include errors like:

```
Caused by: java.net.UnknownHostException: fqdn.example.com: Name or service not known
        at java.base/java.net.Inet4AddressImpl.lookupAllHostAddr(Native Method) ~[na:na]
        at java.base/java.net.InetAddress$PlatformNameService.lookupAllHostAddr(InetAddress.java:929) ~[na:na]
```

The fully-qualified domain names (FQDNs) that you use for vCenter or the <%= vars.control_plane %       > VM contain uppercase letters.

Running `nslookup` from your <%= vars.control_plane %       > VM succeeds with the FQDN with uppercase letters, but fails when you convert them to lowercase.

**Explanation**

BOSH DNS, which <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %     > uses for its internal DNS, does not support uppercase letters in FQDNs.

**Workaround**

Use only lowercase letters in FQDNs that you assign to your vCenter or <%= vars.control_plane %     > VM in <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %     >.  

#%>


#### <a id='1-8-0-whitespace-pksapi'></a> The <%= vars.control_plane %> FQDN Must Not Include Trailing Whitespace

**Symptom**

Your <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> logs include the following error:

```
'uaa'. Errors are:- Error filling in template 'uaa.yml.erb' (line 59: Client redirect-uri is invalid: uaa.clients.pks_cli.redirect-uri Client redirect-uri is invalid: uaa.clients.pks_cluster_client.redirect-uri)
```

**Explanation**

The <%= vars.control_plane %> fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) for your cluster contains leading or trailing whitespace.  

**Workaround**

Do not include whitespace in the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> tile **API Hostname (FQDN)** field.  


#### <a id='1-8-0-do-notuse-resize-cluster'></a> The TKGI CLI Resize and Update Cluster Commands Remove the Network Profile CNI Configuration from a Cluster

**Symptom**

The network profile CNI configuration on a network profile-configured cluster is dropped when updating the cluster using the `tkgi` CLI `resize`, `update-cluster`, and `update-clusters` commands. 

**Workaround**

The network profile configuration can only be restored by recreating the cluster with the network profile.  


### <a id='1-8-0-import-single-cert'></a> The <%= vars.control_plane %> Does Not Import the Current <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> CA Certificates 

**Symptom**

After rotating your <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> CA certificates, you notice the following:

* When using the <%= vars.control_plane %>, SSL authentication returns the following error and fails:  

    ```
    None of the TrustManagers trust this certificate chain executing POST https://100.104.252.16:8443/oauth/token
    ```
* The keystore file at `/var/vcap/jobs/pks-api/config/cacerts.jks`, contains only a single, stale certificate.

<br>
**Explanation** 

The keystore file used by the <%= vars.control_plane %> has not been updated with current CA certificates.

The <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console v1.8.0 has the following known issues:

#### <a id='1-8-0-nsxt-cert'></a> TKGI Management Console regenerates certificates if the NSX Manager admin password changes

**Symptom**

If the admin password for NSX Manager changes and you update it in the TKGI Management Console, the certificates for NSX-T Data Center and Harbor are regenerated. This causes the NCP process on the master node VM to fail for all existing clusters.

**Workaround**

Upgrade the affected clusters.

#### <a id="management-console-1-8-0-vrli-https"></a> vRealize Log Insight Integration Does Not Support HTTPS Connections

**Symptom**

The <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console integration to vRealize Log Insight does not support connections to the HTTPS port on the vRealize Log Insight server. 

**Workaround**

1. Use SSH to log in to the <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console appliance VM.
1. Open the file `/lib/systemd/system/pks-loginsight.service` in a text editor.
1. Add `-e LOG_SERVER_ENABLE_SSL_VERIFY=false`.  
1. Set `-e LOG_SERVER_USE_SSL=true`. 
   
    The resulting file should look like the following example:
       
    ```
    ExecStart=/bin/docker run --privileged --restart=always --network=pks 
    -v /var/log/journal:/var/log/journal 
    --name=pks-loginsight 
    -e TYPE=gear2-vm 
    -e LOG_SERVER_HOST=${LOGINSIGHT_HOST} 
    -e LOG_SERVER_PORT=${LOGINSIGHT_PORT} 
    -e LOG_SERVER_ENABLE_SSL_VERIFY=false 
    -e LOG_SERVER_USE_SSL=true 
    -e LOG_SERVER_AGENT_ID=${LOGINSIGHT_ID} 
    pksoctopus/vrli-journald:v07092019
    ```      
   
1. Save the file and run `systemctl daemon-reload`.
1. To restart the vRealize Log Insight service, run `systemctl restart pks-loginsight.service`.
 
<%= vars.product_short %> Management Console can now send logs to the HTTPS port on the vRealize Log Insight server.

#### <a id="management-console-1-8-0-vsphere-ha"></a> vSphere HA causes Management Console ovfenv Data Corruption

**Symptom**

If you enable vSphere HA on a cluster, if the TKGI Management Console appliance VM is running on a host in that cluster, and if the host reboots, vSphere HA recreates a new TKGI Management Console appliance VM on another host in the cluster. Due to an issue with vSphere HA, the `ovfenv` data for the newly created appliance VM is corrupted and the new appliance VM does not boot up with the correct network configuration. 

**Workaround**

- In the vSphere Client, right-click the appliance VM and select **Power** > **Shut Down Guest OS**.
- Right-click the appliance again and select Edit Settings.
- Select **VM Options** and click **OK**.
- Verify under Recent Tasks that a `Reconfigure virtual machine` task has run on the appliance VM.
- Power on the appliance VM.

#### <a id="management-console-1-8-0-k8s-profile"></a> Base64 encoded file arguments are not decoded in Kubernetes profiles

**Symptom**

Some file arguments in Kubernetes profiles are base64 encoded. When the management console displays the Kubernetes profile,
some file arguments are not decoded.

**Workaround**

Run `echo "$content" | base64 --decode` 

#### <a id="management-console-1-8-0-network-profile"></a> Network profiles not immediately selectable

**Symptom**

If you create network profiles and then try to apply them in the Create Cluster page, the new profiles 
are not available for selection. 

**Workaround**

Log out of the management console and log back in again.

#### <a id="management-console-1-8-0-cluster-summary"></a> Real-Time IP information not displayed for network profiles

**Symptom**

In the cluster summary page, only default IP pool, pod IP block, node IP block values are displayed, 
rather than the real-time values from the associated network profile. 

**Workaround**

None

#### <a id='management-console-1-8-0-cvds-network-profiles'></a> Network Profiles Are Not Present on the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Management Console UI

**Symptom** 

Your <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Network Profiles are missing from the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Management Console UI.
  
**Explanation**   

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Management Console does not support C-VDS and cannot display your Network Profile configurations.

#### <a id='management-console-1-8-0-addons-spec'></a> Management Console Deletes Custom Workload Configurations

**Symptom**
