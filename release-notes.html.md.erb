&#42; Components marked with an asterisk have been updated.

&#42;&#42; As of May 7, 2024, NSX networking and firewall components are sold separately from TKGI.

&#42;&#42;&#42; Migration from NSX Management Plane API to NSX Policy API requires VMware NSX v4.0.1.1 or later. NSX v4.0.1.1 supports only 50% of NSX Management Plane API
scale. To use Policy API at 100% of Management Plane API scale, you require NSX v4.1.1.

### <a id="1-17-5-breaking-changes"></a>Breaking Changes

As of the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.17.5 release date, you can find Management Console downloads at [Broadcom Support](https://support.broadcom.com/group/ecx/productdownloads?subfamily=VMware%20Tanzu%20Kubernetes%20Grid%20Integrated%20Edition) (login required) instead of [VMware Customer Connect](https://customerconnect.vmware.com). The TKGI CLI continues to be distributed on [VMware Tanzu Network](https://network.pivotal.io) until May 31, 2024.

The TKGI downloads page on Broadcom Support organizes TKGI downloads as follows:

* **Workload Backup and Recovery**: Some of the Velero backup tools for TKGI.
* **VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition**: The TKGI OSL and Ops Manager tile.
* **TKG Integrated Edition**: The TKGI Management Console and other Velero backup tools for TKGI.

<br>
### <a id="1-17-5-features"></a><a id="1-17-5-enhancements"></a> Features and Enhancements

* Cluster update retry setting: Ops Manager TKGI tile > **TKGI API** > **Automatic retry on cluster update operations failure** option sets TKGI to retry `tkgi update-cluster` process up to three times if it fails, to improve resilience.

<br>
### <a id="1-17-5-bug-fixes"></a>Resolved Issues

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.17.5 resolves the following issues:

* Fixes [Wrong Node Scale after Updating Cluster with New Compute Profile](#1-17-0-scale-update).
* Added `Strict-Transport-Security` header to nginx HTTPS server configuration on Management Console VM to improve security scan results.
* Fixes [Ephemeral storage overrun with temporary logfiles from Fluentd](#1-17-0-fluentd-logs).
* Fixes cluster creation error when `service-cluster-ip-range` in a custom Kubernetes profile is set to a smaller range than the **Networking** > **Kubernetes Service Network CIDR Range** setting in the TKGI Ops Manager tile.
* Fixes `Error creating NSX-T cluster network... Invalid transport path` error in NSX Policy API mode.
* SSH configuration improvements address [CVE-2023-48795](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-48795).

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> MC v1.17.2 has the following additional known issue.

#### <a id="management-console-1-17-2-no-ssh-opsman"></a>Cannot SSH in to Ops Manager Using Displayed Key

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.17.3](#1-17-3-bug-fixes).

**Symptom**

After upgrading to TKGI v1.17.2 you cannot use the key displayed in the Management Console > **Deployment Metadata** tab to `ssh` in to the Ops Manager VM as described in [Connect to Operations Manager with SSH](console-login-opsmanager.html#ops-manager-ssh) .

**Explanation**

The upgrade process generates a new SSH private key but does not update its value as shown in the Management Console > **Deployment Metadata** tab. After upgrade, the displayed key no longer matches any public key in the Ops Manager VM's `/home/ubuntu/.ssh/authorized_keys`.

**Workaround**

Retrieve and use an up-to-date SSH private key from a configuration file on the TKG Management Console VM:

1. `ssh` in to the Management Console VM as root:

    ```
    ssh root@MC-IP-ADDRESS
    ```

    Where `MC-IP-ADDRESS` is the IP address that you use to access the Management Console with a browser as described in [Step 2: Log In to <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Management Console](console-deploy-ova.html#access-console).

1. Retrieve the private key from the file `/etc/vmware/.pks/om_root_ca`.

1. `ssh` in to the Ops Manager VM by passing the private key to the `-i` flag of `ssh`. For example, to connect to the Ops Manager VM directly from the MC VM:

    ```
    ssh -i /etc/vmware/.pks/om_root_ca ubuntu@OPS-MANAGER-IP
    ```

    You can also copy the private key to `ssh` from your local workstation.

### <a id="1-17-0-upgrade"></a>Upgrade Path

The supported upgrade paths to <%= vars.product_short %> v1.17.0 are from 
<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.16.2 and earlier <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.16 patches.  

<br>
### <a id="1-17-0-breaking-changes"></a>Breaking Changes

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.17.0 has the following breaking changes:  

* **Removals in Kubernetes v1.26**: The following APIs are removed in Kubernetes v1.26:

  * `v1alpha2` CRI API
  * `v1beta1` flow control API group
  * `v2beta2` HorizontalPodAutoscaler API
  
  For information on other removals in Kubernetes v1.26, see 
  [Kubernetes Removals, Deprecations, and Major Changes in 1.26](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2022/11/18/upcoming-changes-in-kubernetes-1-26/) in 
  Kubernetes Blog.

* **In-Tree vSphere Storage Volume Support**:  In-Tree vSphere Storage volume support has been entirely removed. 
The <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.17 upgrade automatically migrates <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> clusters from in-tree vSphere storage to the CSI Driver for vSphere. 
<%= vars.recommended_by %> strongly recommends that you migrate your in-tree vSphere storage volumes to vSphere CSI volumes before upgrading to <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.17. 
For information on how to manually migrate In-Tree vSphere Storage volumes on existing <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> clusters from In-Tree vSphere Storage 
to the automatically installed vSphere CSI Driver, see 
[Migrate an In-Tree vSphere Storage Volume to the vSphere CSI Driver](vsphere-cns.html#migrate-to-csi) 
in _Deploying and Managing Cloud Native Storage (CNS) on vSphere_.  

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> If you have <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>-provisioned Windows worker clusters, do not activate the <strong>Upgrade all clusters</strong> errand before upgrading to the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.17 tile.
You cannot use the <strong>Upgrade all clusters</strong> errand because you must manually migrate each individual Windows worker cluster to the CSI Driver for vSphere. 
For more information, see <a href="vsphere-cns.html#windows-configure-csi">Configure vSphere CSI for Windows</a> in <em>Deploying and Managing Cloud Native Storage (CNS) on vSphere</em>.</p>

<br>
### <a id="1-17-0-features"></a> Features and Enhancements

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.17.0 includes the following features:  

<br>
#### <a id="1-17-0-upgrade-cluster-enhancements"></a> Cluster Upgrade Enhancements

The `tkgi upgrade-cluster` CLI command includes the following enhancements:  

* Supports upgrading a cluster's worker nodes in parallel. 
For more information, see [Upgrade Worker Nodes in Parallel](upgrade-clusters.html#upgrade-nodes-in-parallel) in _Upgrading Clusters_.  
* Supports automated cluster validation before upgrading a cluster. 
For more information, see [Upgrade Cluster Validation](upgrade-clusters.html#upgrade-cluster-pre-check) in _Upgrading Clusters_.  

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: These enhancements apply to <code>tkgi upgrade-cluster</code> only. For example, when using <code>tkgi upgrade-clusters</code>, the clusters can be upgraded in parallel, 
but the worker nodes within an upgrading cluster are always upgraded serially.
</p>

<% if vars.product_version == "COMMENTED"  %>
To upgrade worker nodes in parallel in <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.17.0 and later, 
configure the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> tile > **<%= vars.control_plane %>** tab > **Worker VM Max in Flight** setting 
with the number of non-canary worker instances to upgrade in parallel. 
For more information, see the [**<%= vars.control_plane %>**](installing-vsphere.html.md.erb#tkgi-api) 
in the Installing <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> tile topic for your IaaS.  
<% end %>



<br>
#### <a id="1-17-0-compute-profile-enhancements"></a> Compute Profile Enhancements

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.17.0 includes the following compute profile enhancements:  

* Supports configuring compute profiles with a node pool description. 
For more information, see [`node_pools` Block](compute-profiles-manage.html#worker-nodes) in 
_Creating and Managing Compute Profiles with the CLI (vSphere)_.  
* Supports optionally skipping compute profile validation. For more information, 
see [Assign a Compute Profile](compute-profiles-use.html#update-profile-procedure) in _Using Compute Profiles (vSphere)_.  
* Prevents updating an existing compute profile with unsupported configuration changes. Prevents: Changing the number of control plane nodes, changing the node pool `name` property, and adding a new node pool while deleting an existing node pool.  

<br>
#### <a id="1-17-0-csi-enhancements"></a> CSI Driver for vSphere Enhancements

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.17.0 includes the following CSI Driver for vSphere enhancements:  

* Supports the XFS file system on Linux clusters. 
For more information, see [Use XFS File System with vSphere Container Storage Plug-in](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere-Container-Storage-Plug-in/3.0/vmware-vsphere-csp-getting-started/GUID-752B928E-8493-4387-8447-D72839899230.html) 
in the VMware vSphere Container Storage Plug-in documentation.  
* Supports the CSI Driver for vSphere on Windows clusters. 
For more information, see [Configure vSphere CSI for Windows](vsphere-cns.html#windows-configure-csi) 
in _Deploying and Managing Cloud Native Storage (CNS) on vSphere_.


<br>
#### <a id="1-17-0-enhancements"></a>Additional Features

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.17.0 includes the following additional features:  

* Supports VMware vSphere v8.0 and VMware vSAN 8.0. For more information, see

#### <a id="1-17-0-fluentd-logs"></a> Ephemeral storage overrun with temporary logfiles from Fluentd

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.17.5](#1-17-5-bug-fixes).

**Symptom**

Fluentd component logfiles that contain error text `invalid byte sequence in UTF-8` fill up and overrun ephemeral storage on cluster, for example `/tmp/fluent/backup/worker0/object_c79c/` mapped to ephemeral storage disk `dev/sdb1`.

**Workaround**

Modify Fluentd configuration by changing its log handling code `out_loginsight_buffered.rb` as follows:

1. Upload the latest BOSH release to the BOSH Director:

  ```
  bosh upload-release --sha1 daf34e35f1ac678ba05db3496c4226064b99b3e4 "https://bosh.io/d/github.com/cloudfoundry/os-conf-release?v=22.2.1" 
  ```

  For a different release, download it with `wget https://bosh.io/d/github.com/cloudfoundry/os-conf-release?v=RELEASE"` and calculate its SHA-1 with `shasum os-conf-release\?v\=RELEASE"`.

1. Create a runtime config file `runtime.yml` with the following code, to modify the `out_loginsight_buffered.rb` code:

  ```
  releases:
  - name: "os-conf"
    version: "22.2.1"
  addons:
  - name: os-configuration
    include:
      deployments: [dep1,dep2...]  =====> need to change to the cluster deployment id that you want to apply the change, if you want apply the change to all the clusters, just delete the include section.
    jobs:
    - name: pre-start-script
      release: os-conf
      properties:
        script: |-
          #!/bin/bash
          if [ -d "/var/vcap/jobs/fluentd/packages/vrli-fluentd/plugins/" ]; then
            sed -i 's/force_encoding("utf-8")/encode!('\''UTF-8'\'', '\''binary'\'', invalid: :replace, undef: :replace, replace: '\'' '\'' )/g' /var/vcap/jobs/fluentd/packages/vrli-fluentd/plugins/out_loginsight_buffered.rb
            echo "done"
          fi
  ```

1. Apply the runtime config file to the BOSH Director, giving it the name `runtime-fluentd`:

  ```
  bosh update-runtime-config --name runtime-fluentd runtime.yml
  ```

1. Check if the runtime config been set successfully:

  ```
  bosh runtime-config  --name runtime-fluentd
  ```

  The command output should list the contents of `runtime.yml`.

1. Upgrade the cluster with ephemeral storage overrun, to apply the new runtime config:

  ```
  tkgi upgrade-cluster CLUSTER-NAME
  ```

1. Log in to a cluster worker or master node and check that the file `/var/vcap/jobs/fluentd/packages/vrli-fluentd/plugins/out_loginsight_buffered.rb` includes the following lines:

  ```
  key.encode!('UTF-8', 'binary', invalid: :replace, undef: :replace, replace: ' ' )
  ...
  value.encode!('UTF-8', 'binary', invalid: :replace, undef: :replace, replace: ' ' )
  ```

1. Check that no more logfiles are routing to the directory `/tmp/fluent/backup/worker0` and no more error logs containing `invalid byte sequence in UTF-8` are writing to `/var/vcap/sys/log/fluentd.stdout.log`.

1. (Optional) Delete the runtime config:

  ```
  bosh delete-config --type runtime --name runtime-fluentd
  ```

  Unless you delete it, the runtime config persists in the BOSH Director and is applied with TKGI updates and upgrades, and other operations that run `bosh deploy`.
  After you upgrade to a TKGI version that fixes this issue, leaving the runtime config in place is harmless, but it does leave an unneeded file on the BOSH Director filesystem and make BOSH execute an unnecessary script.

#### <a id="1-17-0-containerd-istio"></a> TKGI version upgrade without new stemcell fails for Containerd runtime clusters with Istio CNI

**Symptom**

On clusters configured to use a containerd registry and Istio CNI, upgrading the TKGI version without also upgrading the stemcell fails with errors kubelet `cannot find istio-cni binary` and `nsx fails to recieve message header`.

This error does not occur when you upgrade to a new stemcell along with the new TKGI version.

**Explanation**

When TKGI cluster upgrades and drains the node during upgrade, it leaves the cluster nodes' Istio CNI agent and CNI configuration in a corrupted state.

If the cluster nodes are not automatically re-created by a stemcell change, the corrupted Istio CNI state remains.

**Workaround**

For clusters that use both Containerd and Istio CNI:

* If you have already encountered this issue, re-create all worker nodes using the `bosh recreate` command:

  1. Run the `bosh vms` command to list the cluster VMs:

      ```
      bosh -d service-instance-DEPLOYMENT-ID vms
      ```
      Where `DEPLOYMENT-ID` is the BOSH-generated ID of your Kubernetes cluster deployment.

  1. For each VM instance listed as `worker/UUID` in the output, run `bosh recreate VM-NAME`:

      ```
      bosh -d service-instance-DEPLOYMENT-ID recreate worker/UUID
      ```

* In the future, you can avoid this issue by upgrading a cluster's stemcell whenever you upgrade its TKGI version.

#### <a id="1-17-0-tap-labels"></a> NSX pod creation fails when using Tanzu Application Platform

**Symptom**

When you deploy a workload on a <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>-provisioned cluster with NSX networking that is running [Tanzu Application Platform](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Platform/index.html) (TAP), you see an error `Failed to create pod sandbox` and no resources are created in the cluster's `nsx-system` namespace.

**Explanation**

The total number of Kubernetes object labels and other tags created by both <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> and TAP can exceed the number that is allowed by NSX.

**Workaround**

Create or update your network profile as described in [Creating and Managing Network Profiles (NSX Only)](network-profiles-define.md), setting the `cni_configurations` parameter `extensions.ncp.k8s.label_filtering_regex_list` as described under [label_filtering Settings](network-profiles-define.md#label-filtering).

<hr>

#### <a id="1-17-0-no-pool"></a> Error Scaling Clusters when Compute Profile Lacks Node Pool

**Symptom**

When you scale up a cluster by passing `--num-nodes` to `tkgi cluster-upgrade` you see the error `An error occurred in the PKS API`.

The pks-api.log includes: `Request processing failed; nested exception is java.lang.NullPointerException`, which triggers within the nested `ClusterService` methods `extractCustomizationNodePoolNames` < `validateComputeProfileUuidAndKubernetesWorkerInstances` < `updateCluster`.

**Explanation**

The cluster's Compute Profile lacks a node-pool specification, and
setting `--num-nodes` for cluster updating does not work when the
Compute Profile does not specify a node pool.

**Workaround**

Create and apply a new compute profile that specifies a node pool:

1. Create a new JSON compute profile definition that defines a node pool with a worker node instance count. For example, this code defines a compute profile `cp-1` with target instance count `16`:

  ```
    cat cp-1.json
    {
      "name": "cp-1",
      "description": "compute profile 1",
      "parameters": {
        "cluster_customization": {
          "control_plane": {
            "cpu": 2,
            "memory_in_mb": 8192,
            "persistent_disk_in_mb": 28240,
            "ephemeral_disk_in_mb": 28240,
            "instances": 3
          },
          "node_pools": [
            {
              "name": "pool-1",
              "description": "node pool 1",
              "instances": 16
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  ```

1. Apply the new compute profile to the cluster:

  ```
  tkgi update-cluster my-cluster --compute-profile cp-1.json
  ```

  When you apply the new profile, the worker nodes migrate from instance group `worker` to the new instance group, `worker-pool-1`. If the instance count exceeds the number specified in plan, <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> adds instances to the new group before updating existing instances.

After the new node pool is created, you can scale the cluster by running:

  ```
  tkgi update-cluster cluster-1 --node-pool-instances "POOL:COUNT"
  ```

  Where `POOL` is the node pool name and `COUNT` is its instance count.

#### <a id="1-17-0-scale-update"></a> Wrong Node Scale after Updating Cluster with New Compute Profile

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.17.5](#1-17-5-bug-fixes).

**Symptom**

For clusters created with or assigned a compute profile as described in [Using Compute Profiles](compute-profiles-use.html), scaling the cluster by updating its compute profile and then performing additional cluster update operations may leave the cluster with the wrong node count.

For example, after the following steps, the cluster may have a node count of 12 instead of 18 in its updated node pool:

1. Create cluster `my-cluster` with a compute profile `cp-1` that defines a node pool `pool-1` with 6 nodes.
1. Scale the cluster to 12 nodes by running `tkgi update-cluster my-cluster --node-pool-instances "pool-1:12"`.
1. Create a new compute profile `cp-2` that sets the `pool-1` node pool to 18 nodes.
1. Update the cluster with the profile `cp-2` by running `tkgi update-cluster my-cluster --compute-profile cp-2`.
1. Rotate the cluster's certificates or perform other `tkgi update-cluster` operations.

After the last step, the cluster pool's node count may erroneously revert to 12.

**Workaround**

After you update a cluster with a new compute profile that changes node counts, run `tkgi update-cluster CLUSTER-NAME  --node-pool-instances "NODEPOOL-NAME:NODE-COUNT"` where `NODE-COUNT` is the new node count.

With the example above, after Step 3 run `tkgi update-cluster my-cluster --node-pool-instances "pool-1:18"`.

#### <a id="1-17-0-lose-adv-settings"></a> Updating cluster compute profile loses node drain and shutdown settings

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.17.5](#management-console-1-17-5-features).

**Symptom**

In the management console, when you update a Linux cluster that is created with a compute profile as described in [Update Cluster Configuration](console-create-clusters.md#update-clusters), the **Advanced Settings** panel shows and applies incorrect defaults for node drain and pod shutdown grace period settings.

**Workaround**

Under **Update Cluster**, before you change the **Compute Profile** setting, click **Show More** to open the **Advanced Settings**. Record the current settings, and set them back if selecting a compute profile changes those settings.

Default settings are:

  - Node Train Timeout: 0
  - Pod Shutdown Grace Period: 10
  - Enabled: Force drain if externally-managed pods
  - Enabled: Force drain if DaemonSet-managed pods

#### <a id="1-17-0-renamed-ops-man"></a> TKGI MC Unable to Manage TKGI after Restoring the TKGI Control Plane from Backup

**Symptom**

After you restore Ops Manager and the <%= vars.control_plane %> VM from backup,
<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> functions normally, but your <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> MC tabs
include the following error: "...product 'pivotal-container service' is not deployed...".

**Explanation**

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> MC is associated with an Ops Manager with a specific name.
If you rename Ops Manager with a new name while restoring, your <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> MC
will not recognize the restored Ops Manager and cannot manage it.

#### <a id="1-17-0-backslash-username"></a> vSphere CSI Failure When Backslash in User Name

**Symptom**

When installing or upgrading <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> with vSphere Container Storage Plug-in (CSI) enabled, CSI pods fail with the error `ErrImageNeverPull` and cluster logs show the error `unknown escape sequence`.

**Explanation**

The CSI driver cannot correctly parse the vCenter username configuration setting if it contains a backslash  (`\`) character.

**Workaround**

When entering a vCenter user name in the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Configuration Wizard or Ops Manager tile, use the format `user@domainname`, for example: "_user@example.com_". It cannot contain a backslash (`\`) character.

#### <a id="1-17-0-resizing-worker-nodes"></a> Ingress Controller Statefulset Fails to Start After Resizing Worker Nodes

**Symptom**

Permissions are removed from your cluster's files and processes after resizing the persistent disk
during a cluster upgrade. The ingress controller statefulset fails to start.

**Explanation**

When resizing a persistent disk, Bosh migrates the data from the old disk to the new disk but
does not copy the files' extended attributes.

**Workaround**

To resolve the problem, complete the steps in

#### <a id="1-17-0-security-group"></a>Azure Default Security Group Is Not Automatically Assigned to Cluster VMs

**Symptom**

You experience issues when configuring a load balancer for a multi-control plane node Kubernetes cluster or creating a service of type `LoadBalancer`.
Additionally, in the Azure portal, the **VM** > **Networking** page does not display
any inbound and outbound traffic rules for your cluster VMs.

**Explanation**

As part of configuring the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile for Azure, you enter **Default Security Group** in the **Kubernetes Cloud Provider** pane.
When you create a Kubernetes cluster, <%= vars.product_short %> automatically assigns this security group to each VM in the cluster.
However, on Azure the automatic assignment might not occur.

As a result, your inbound and outbound traffic rules defined in the security group are not applied to the cluster VMs.

**Workaround**

If you experience this issue, manually assign the default security group to each VM NIC in your cluster.

<hr>

#### <a id="1-17-0-uuid-length"></a> One Plan ID Longer than Other Plan IDs

**Symptom**

One of your plan IDs is one character longer than your other plan IDs.

**Explanation**

In <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>, each plan has a unique plan ID.
A plan ID is normally a UUID consisting of 32 alphanumeric characters and 4 hyphens.
However, the **Plan 4** ID consists of 33 alphanumeric characters and 4 hyphens.

**Solution**

You can safely configure and use **Plan 4**.
The length of the **Plan 4** ID does not affect the functionality of **Plan 4** clusters.

If you require all plan IDs to have identical length, do not activate or use **Plan 4**.

#### <a id="1-17-0-ovsdb-server-failure"></a> Occasionally update-cluster Does Not Complete for Windows Workers

Occasionally, `tkgi update-cluster` hangs while updating a Windows worker node instance and the BOSH task cannot finish and exits.

**Symptom**

The `ovsdb-server` service has stopped but other processes report that it is running.

**Explanation**

The `ovsdb-server.pid` file uses the pid for a process that is not the ovsdb-server.

To confirm that this is the root cause for `tkgi update-cluster` to hang:

* To verify the `ovsdb-server` service has actually stopped, run the PowerShell `Get-services` command on the Windows worker node.
* To verify that other processes report the `ovsdb-server` service is still running:
<br>
    1. Review the ovsdb-server `job-service-wrapper.err.log` log file.
<br>
        The `job-service-wrapper.err.log` log file is located at:

        ```
        C:\var\vcap\sys\log\openvswitch-windows\ovsdb-server\job-service-wrapper.err.log
        ```
    1. Confirm that after the flushing processes, the log includes an error similar to the following:

        ```
        Pid-Guard : ovsdb-server is already runing, please stop it first
        At C:\var\vcap\jobs\openvswitch-windows\bin\ovsdb-server_ctl.ps1:30 char:5
        +     Pid-Guard $PIDFILE "ovsdb-server"
        +     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
            + CategoryInfo          : NotSpecified: ( [Write-Error], WriteErrorException
            + FullyQualifiedErrorId : Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.WriteErrorException,Pid-Guard
        ```
* To verify the root cause:
<br>
    1. Run the following PowerShell commands on the Windows worker node:

        ```
        $RUN_DIR = "C:\var\vcap\sys\run\openvswitch-windows"
        $PIDFILE = "$RUN_DIR\ovsdb-server.pid"
        $pid1 = Get-Content $PidFile -First 1
        echo $pid1
        $rst = Get-Process -Id $pid1 -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
        echo $rst
        ```
    1. Confirm the returned `ProcessName` is not `ovsdb-server`.

**Workaround**

To resolve this issue for a single Windows worker:

1. SSH to the affected worker node.
1. Run the following:

    ```
    rm C:\var\vcap\sys\run\openvswitch-windows\ovsdb-server.pid
    ```
1. Wait for the `ovsdb-server` process to start.
1. Confirm the dependent services also start.

#### <a id="1-17-0-missing-cluster-name-tag"></a> Cluster Might Fail to Send the `cluster_name` Tag to Logging after Cluster Upgrade

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.17.1](#1-17-1-bug-fixes).  

Occasionally, a cluster might fail to send the `cluster_name` tag to logging after being upgraded.  

**Description**  

After upgrading a cluster, the `Name record_modifier` filter will occasionally be missing from the cluster's fluent-bit ConfigMap, and the cluster_name is not included in log entries. This problem occurs if the sink-controller process configures the cluster before the observability-manager starts, which overwrites the desired configuration.  

<hr>

#### <a id="1-17-0-duplicate-cluster-tag"></a> Cluster Update Operations Fail Due to Duplicate Tag Keys

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.17.2](#1-17-2-bug-fixes).  

The cluster update operations fail if you reuse the same key in different tags in a cluster.

**Description**  

Tag keys must be unique within a cluster, for example, `key1:value1, key2:value2`. <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> does not prevent you from reusing the same key 
for multiple tags in a cluster, for example, `key1:value1, key1:value2`. However, the cluster update operations fail.

#### <a id="1-17-0-ignore-node-drain-timeout"></a> Node Drain Operation Ignores the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Deployment Plan Settings 

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.17.2](#1-17-2-bug-fixes).  

When upgrading a cluster, the node drain operation ignores the pod shutdown grace period specified in the deployment plan on the 
<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Tile.

#### <a id="1-17-0-pods-notready-from-dfw"></a> Pods on NSX v3.2.3 Can Enter a NotReady State

When <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> is deployed on NSX v3.2.3 and there are large numbers of pods with [liveness probes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/#define-a-liveness-command), the pods on <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>-provisioned clusters can enter a `NotReady` state.

**Symptom**  

In addition to your pods being `NotReady`, if you restart NSX Manager:  

* Your NSX API logs include numerous repetitions of 
`"POST /nsxapi/api/v1/firewall/sections/.../rules?operation=insert_bottom HTTP/1.1" ...`.  
* Your NCP logs include errors similar to:  

    ```
    "nsx-container-ncp" subcomp="ncp" level="ERROR" security="True" errorCode="NCP00034"] nsx_ujo.ncp.nsx.manager.firewall_service Failed to create health check rule for port ...: Service cluster: 'https://nsx-manager.example.com' is unavailable. Please, check NSX setup and/or configuration.
    ``` 

**Description**  

As pods are created or deleted, DFW firewall rules are replicated for the pod's liveness probe. 
In NSX v3.2.3, the firewall rules are unintentionally duplicated during this replication. 
After numerous pod creation/deletion events, 
the compounded duplication creates a DFW firewall section large enough to create noticeable delays during pod operations and, eventually, a pod `NotReady` state.  

**Workaround**  

Upgrade NSX to a version that includes the fix, namely 3.2.4 or 4.1.1 or later.

#### <a id="management-console-1-17-0-om-vm-restart"></a> Cannot log in to the TKGI MC after restarting Ops Manager v3 VM from vSphere

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.17.4](#management-console-1-17-4-features).

**Symptom**

With TKGI deployed by the Management Console (MC), after you restart the Ops Manager v3 VM from vSphere, you cannot log in to the MC, and the MC can no longer communicate with Ops Manager.

**Workaround**

First, determine if the Ops Manager VM address changed when you restarted it.
If so, the following steps will restore its original IP address.

The MC deploys Ops Manager to the first IP in TKGI's Deployment CIDR range, following the Gateway address, as configured under **Network Resources** in the MC.
You can also retrieve the Deployment CIDR from the TKGI tile in Ops Manager, under **Networks** > **Subnets** > **CIDR** and **Gateway**. If the Gateway address ends in `1` and is the first in the CIDR, the Ops Manager address ends in `2`.

If the Ops Manager IP shown in vSphere is not the first IP in the Deployment CIDR range for TKGI, its address has changed.

If the Ops Manager VM address has changed, remove its `networkd` service and restart the VM so that its networking service picks up the correct, static IP from its OVF settings:

1. From vSphere, `ssh` in to the Ops Manager VM.
1. Run `sudo mv /usr/lib/systemd/system/*networkd* /root/`
1. Restart the Ops Manager VM from the vSphere, and check its IP address to see if it has changed back to the correct address, the first IP in the TKGI Deployment CIDR.
1. If the Ops Manager VM still does not have the correct IP address, continue with the following steps.
1. From vSphere, power off the Ops Manager VM.
1. Update the Ops Manager VM's network settings to specify a network that supports DHCP, and record its previous network settings.

  - You will need to `ssh` in to the Ops Manager VM again, so if it lacks a DHCP network adapter you need some other way to access it. For example: mount its disk to another VM, inject an Ubuntu user password, and then use the vSphere GUI to power on the Ops Manager VM and log in with the new password.

1. Power on the Ops Manager VM. It should have an IP address assigned by DHCP.
1. `ssh` to the Ops Manager VM.
1. Run `sudo mv /usr/lib/systemd/system/*networkd* /root/`
1. Power off the Ops Manager VM.
1. Update the VM's network settings again to revert to its previous network configuration.
1. Power on the Ops Manager VM again. It should now have the correct static IP.

#### <a id="management-console-1-17-0-vrli-https"></a> vRealize Log Insight Integration Does Not Support HTTPS Connections

**Symptom**

The <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console integration to vRealize Log Insight does not support connections to the HTTPS port on the vRealize Log Insight server.

**Workaround**

1. Use SSH to log in to the <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console appliance VM.
1. Open the file `/lib/systemd/system/pks-loginsight.service` in a text editor.
1. Add `-e LOG_SERVER_ENABLE_SSL_VERIFY=false`.
1. Set `-e LOG_SERVER_USE_SSL=true`.

    The resulting file should look like the following example:

    ```
    ExecStart=/bin/docker run --privileged --restart=always --network=pks
    -v /var/log/journal:/var/log/journal
    --name=pks-loginsight
    -e TYPE=gear2-vm
    -e LOG_SERVER_HOST=${LOGINSIGHT_HOST}
    -e LOG_SERVER_PORT=${LOGINSIGHT_PORT}
    -e LOG_SERVER_ENABLE_SSL_VERIFY=false
    -e LOG_SERVER_USE_SSL=true
    -e LOG_SERVER_AGENT_ID=${LOGINSIGHT_ID}
    pksoctopus/vrli-journald:v07092019
    ```

1. Save the file and run `systemctl daemon-reload`.
1. To restart the vRealize Log Insight service, run `systemctl restart pks-loginsight.service`.

<%= vars.product_short %> Management Console can now send logs to the HTTPS port on the vRealize Log Insight server.

#### <a id="management-console-1-17-0-vsphere-ha"></a> vSphere HA causes Management Console ovfenv Data Corruption

**Symptom**

If you enable vSphere HA on a cluster, if the TKGI Management Console appliance VM is running on a
host in that cluster, and if the host reboots, vSphere HA recreates a new TKGI Management Console
appliance VM on another host in the cluster. Due to an issue with vSphere HA, the `ovfenv` data for
the newly created appliance VM is corrupted and the new appliance VM does not boot up with the
correct network configuration.

**Workaround**

1. In the vSphere Client, right-click the appliance VM and select **Power** > **Shut Down Guest OS**.
1. Right-click the appliance again and select Edit Settings.
1. Select **VM Options** and click **OK**.
1. Verify under Recent Tasks that a `Reconfigure virtual machine` task has run on the appliance VM.
1. Power on the appliance VM.

<hr>

#### <a id="management-console-1-17-0-k8s-profile"></a> Base64 encoded file arguments are not decoded in Kubernetes profiles

**Symptom**

Some file arguments in Kubernetes profiles are base64 encoded. When the management console displays
the Kubernetes profile, some file arguments are not decoded.

**Workaround**

Run `echo "$content" | base64 --decode`

<hr>

#### <a id="management-console-1-17-0-network-profile"></a> Network profiles not immediately selectable

**Symptom**

If you create network profiles and then try to apply them in the Create Cluster page, the new
profiles are not available for selection.

**Workaround**

Log out of the management console and log back in again.

<hr>

#### <a id="management-console-1-17-0-cluster-summary"></a> Real-Time IP information not displayed for network profiles

**Symptom**

In the cluster summary page, only default IP pool, pod IP block, node IP block values are displayed,
rather than the real-time values from the associated network profile.

**Workaround**

None

<hr>
#### <a id="management-console-1-17-0-harbor-storage-config"></a> Error After Modifying Your Harbor Storage Configuration

**Symptom**

You receive the following error after modifying your existing Harbor installation's storage configuration:

```
Error response from daemon: manifest for ... not found: manifest unknown: manifest unknown
```

**Explanation**

Harbor does not support modifying an existing Harbor installation's storage configuration.

**Workaround**

To modify your Harbor storage configuration,
re-install Harbor. Before starting Harbor, configure the new Harbor installation with the desired configuration.

<hr>

#### <a id="management-console-1-17-0-re-import-windows-stemcell"></a> Windows Stemcells Must be Re-Imported After Upgrading Ops Manager

**Symptom**

After upgrading Ops Manager, your Management Console does not recognize a Windows stemcell imported
when using the prior version of Ops Manager.

**Workaround**

If your Management Console does not recognize a Windows stemcell after upgrading Ops Manager:

1. Re-import your previously imported Windows stemcell.
2. **Apply Changes** to <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> MC.

<hr>

#### <a id="management-console-1-17-0-cluster-group-name"></a> Your New Clusters Are Not Shown In Tanzu Mission Control

**Symptom**

After you create a cluster, Tanzu Mission Control does not include the cluster in cluster lists.
You have a "_Resource not found_" error similar to the following in your BOSH logs:

```
Cluster Name in TMC: cluster-1
Cluster Name Prefix: tkgi-my-prefix-
Group Name in TMC: my-prefix-clusters
Cluster Description in TMC: VMware Enterprise PKS Attaching cluster ''tkgi-my-prefix-cluster-1'' to TMC
Fetching token successful
request POST:/v1alpha1/clusters,
response 404 Not Found:{"error":"Resource not found - clustergroup(my-prefix-clusters)
org id(d859dc9f-g622-426d-8c91-939a9f13dea9)",
"code":5,"message":"Resource not found - clustergroup(my-prefix-clusters)
```

**Explanation**

The cluster group you assign a cluster to must be defined in Tanzu Mission Control
before you assign your cluster to the cluster group in the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Management Console.

**Workaround**

To resolve the problem, complete the steps in
[Attaching a Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated (TKGI) cluster to Tanzu Mission Control (TMC) fails with "Resource not found - clustergroup(cluster-group-name)"](https://knowledge.broadcom.com/external/article/298672/attaching-a-tanzu-kubernetes-grid-integr.html)
