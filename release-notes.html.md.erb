#### <a id="1-13-4-runtime-switch-error-vrops"></a> Switching Cluster Container Runtimes Two or More Times Fails on Clusters with vROps Enabled

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.13.5](#1-13-5-bug-fixes).  


Switching a cluster container runtime from Docker to containerd then back to Docker will fail if the cluster is configured with vROps enabled.  

**Symptom**

Switching a cluster container runtime from containerd to Docker fails and logs errors similar to the following:  

```
failed to load listeners: can't create unix socket /var/vcap/sys/run/docker/docker.sock: is a directory
```


**Explanation**

The vrops-cadvisor daemonset mounted `/var/vcap/sys/run/docker/docker.sock` because it did not exist.  



**Workaround**

To resolve this error:  

1. Run the following command to remove the `/var/vcap/sys/run/docker/docker.sock` directory from worker nodes:  

    ```
    bosh -d service-instance_CLUSTER-UUID ssh worker "rm -rf /var/vcap/sys/run/docker/docker.sock"
    ```
    
    Where `CLUSTER-UUID` is the BOSH deployment name of your cluster.  

1. To switch your cluster's container runtime, re-run your `<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> update-cluster` command.  

<hr>

#### <a id="1-13-4-docker-commands-disabled"></a> Docker Commands No Longer Work on Worker VMs

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.13.6](#1-13-6-bug-fixes).  

Clusters using the Docker container runtime no longer default to supporting Docker command line commands.

Supporting containerd as the default container runtime requires Docker-specific features incompatible with containerd are disabled by default.

**Workaround**

In an environment where you want to run Docker commands, complete one of the following:

* Export the Docker environments variables before using Docker commands:
    
    ```
    source /var/vcap/jobs/docker/bin/envrc
    ```
    
    For example:  

    ```
    source /var/vcap/jobs/docker/bin/envrc 

    docker images
    REPOSITORY                                                                   TAG                                        IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
    ...                                                                          1a3337bb81890b6bb1848b5dd4565dfa5d124f38   ffb57751a939   3 months ago    182MB
    ```

* Use absolute Docker paths when referencing Docker:  

    ```
    /var/vcap/packages/docker/bin/docker --host unix:///var/vcap/sys/run/docker/docker.sock
    ```
    
    For example:  

    ```
    /var/vcap/packages/docker/bin/docker --host unix:///var/vcap/sys/run/docker/docker.sock images
    REPOSITORY                                                                   TAG                                        IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
    ...                                                                          1a3337bb81890b6bb1848b5dd4565dfa5d124f38   ffb57751a939   3 months ago    182MB

#### <a id="1-13-3-migrate-container-runtime"></a>Supports Migrating Clusters between Container Runtimes

Kubernetes has deprecated Docker container runtime support and all Docker-runtime clusters must be 
switched to use the containerd container runtime prior to upgrading to <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.15.  

The <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.14 cluster upgrade will automatically switch clusters to the containerd container runtime.  

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning</strong>:  Cluster workloads will experience downtime while the cluster switches 
    from using the Docker runtime to containerd.
</p>

In <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.13.3 and later, the  `tkgi update-cluster` CLI command includes options to 
prepare your clusters for the removal of Docker-runtime support:  

* Supports switching an existing cluster between container runtimes:  

    * From a Docker container runtime to the containerd-runtime.  
    * From a containerd container runtime to a Docker-runtime.  <br>

    For more information, see [Switch a Cluster to a Different Container Runtime](upgrade-clusters.html#migrate-runtime) in _Upgrading Clusters_.  

* Supports locking a cluster to the Docker container runtime:  
<br>
    Locking a cluster to the Docker container runtime prevents the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.14 cluster upgrade 
    from automatically switching the cluster to the containerd-runtime.  
    <br>
    For more information, see 
    [Lock a Cluster to the Docker Container Runtime](upgrade-clusters.html#lock-runtime) in _Upgrading Clusters_ 
    and [Create a Kubernetes Cluster](create-cluster.html#create) in _Creating Clusters_.  

    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> 
    All Docker-runtime clusters must be switched to the containerd-runtime prior to upgrading to <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.15.  
    </p>
    
For more information, see [Customize Cluster Container Runtimes Before Upgrading](upgrade-clusters.html#upgrade-runtime) in _Upgrading Clusters_.  


<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> 
Clusters that are not locked to the Docker-runtime will automatically switch to the containerd container runtime 
during the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.14 cluster upgrade.

#### <a id="1-13-3-docker-upgrade-fail"></a> Docker Service Fails While Upgrading Clusters to <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.13.3

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.13.4](#1-13-4-bug-fixes).   

The Docker service might fail for some Docker container runtime clusters while upgrading the clusters from 
<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.13.2 to <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.13.3.  


**Symptoms**

While upgrading Docker container runtime clusters to <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.13.3, the cluster upgrade fails and logs errors similar to the following:  

```
...operation: update, error-message: 'worker-... (1)' is not running after update. Review logs for failed jobs: docker...
```

```
...worker/...:~# monit summary The Monit daemon 5.2.5 uptime: 1m Process 'docker' Execution failed
```

```
...msg="Handler for POST /v1.41/images/create returned error: Get \"https://registry.tkg.vmware.run/v2/\": dial tcp: lookup registry.tkg.vmware.run on ...: no such host..."
```

**Workaround**

If upgrading a Docker container runtime cluster to <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.13.3 has failed:  

1. Restart the Docker process on that cluster.  
1. If any Pods in the cluster return `Warning FailedCreatePodSandBox`, you must recreate the affected worker node.

#### <a id="1-13-3-runtime-switch-error"></a> Switching Docker Container Runtime to Containerd Container Runtime Might Fail

This issue is fixed in [<  %= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %  > v1.13.4](#1-13-4-bug-fixes).  

Switching a cluster container runtime from Docker to containerd will fail if the cluster is configured with the following parameters:

```
    "unset_http_proxy": ["docker"]
```

**Symptom**

Switching a cluster container runtime from Docker to containerd fails and the container runtime switching log includes an error similar to the following:  

```
Error: Status: 500; ErrorMessage: <nil>; Description: Could not get ops: Invalid job type for unset_http_proxy :'docker', the job type should be runtime; ResponseError: <nil>

Fluent Bit v1.8.5 and later might fail to forward Pod log entries to the desired logging destination and instead return a DNS timeout error.  

**Symptoms**

When Fluent Bit encounters this unexpected DNS resolution issue, it logs Fluent Bit errors similar to the following:  

```
[ warn] [engine] chunk '...' cannot be retried: task_id=1, input=tail.0 > output=splunk.0

[ warn] [net] getaddrinfo(host='...', err=11): Could not contact DNS servers

[ warn] [engine] failed to flush chunk '...', retry in 6 seconds: task_id=11, input=tail.0 > output=splunk.0 (out_id=0)

[ warn] [net] getaddrinfo(host='...', err=11): Could not contact DNS servers

```

**Workaround**

To resolve the Fluent Bit DNS timeout problem:

1. Open the Fluent Bit config map in a text editor.  
1. Add the following to the `OUTPUT` section in the config map:  

    ```
    net.dns.mode   TCP
    ```
    
    For more information on configuring a Fluent Bit ConfigMap, see
    [Installation](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/installation/kubernetes#installation) 
    in the _Fluent Bit Official Manual_ or the example ConfigMap files: 
    [kafka/fluent-bit-configmap.yaml](https://github.com/fluent/fluent-bit-kubernetes-logging/blob/master/output/kafka/fluent-bit-configmap.yaml) and 
    [elasticsearch/fluent-bit-configmap.yaml](https://github.com/fluent/fluent-bit-kubernetes-logging/blob/master/output/elasticsearch/fluent-bit-configmap.yaml) 
    in the Fluent Bit GitHub repository.  
    
1. Perform a rollout restart of Fluent Bit logging:

    ```
    kubectl logs POD-NAME -n NAMESPACE -c CONTAINER-NAME --follow
    ```
    
    Where:  
    * `POD-NAME` is the name of your Pod.  
    * `NAMESPACE` is the namespace for your Pod.  
    * `CONTAINER-NAME` is the name of your Pod container.  
<br>
    
    For more information on restarting Fluent Bit logging, see 
    [Interacting with running Pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/cheatsheet/#interacting-with-running-pods) 
    in _kubectl Cheat Sheet_ in the Kubernetes documentation.  
    

For more information, see 
[DNS resolution timeout/failure in >= 1.8.5 #4050](https://github.com/fluent/fluent-bit/issues/4050) and

#### <a id="1-13-0-cannot-update-dedicated-tier1"></a> <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Does Not Support Updating Dedicated Tier 1 Clusters

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.13.2](#1-13-2-bug-fixes).  

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> does not support updating dedicated Tier 1 clusters.
You can use a Network Profile to create a dedicated Tier 1 cluster, but you cannot use
`tkgi update-cluster` to update the cluster afterward.

#### <a id="1-13-0-renamed-ops-man"></a> TKGI MC Unable to Manage TKGI after Restoring the TKGI Control Plane from Backup

**Symptom**

After you restore Ops Manager and the <%= vars.control_plane %> VM from backup,
<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> functions normally, but your <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> MC tabs
include the following error: "...product 'pivotal-container service' is not deployed...".

**Explanation**

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> MC is associated with an Ops Manager with a specific name.
If you rename Ops Manager with a new name while restoring, your <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> MC
will not recognize the restored Ops Manager and cannot manage it.

<hr>

#### <a id="1-13-0-hyperbus-error"></a> Kubernetes Pods on NSX-T Become Stuck in a Creating State

**Symptom**

The pods in your <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Kubernetes clusters on NSX-T become stuck in a
creating state.
The connections between nsx-node-agent and hyperbus repeatedly close, log 
`Couldn't connect to 'tcp://...' (error: 111-Connection refused)`, and have a status of
`COMMUNICATION_ERROR`.

**Explanation**

For information and workaround steps for this Known Issue, see
[Issue 2795268: Connection between nsx-node-agent and hyperbus flips and Kubernetes pod is stuck at creating state](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center/3.1/rn/NSX-Container-Plugin-312-Release-Notes.html#RNA_11559)

#### <a id="1-13-0-nsxt-302-310"></a> Pods Stop After Upgrading From NSX-T v3.0.2 to v3.1.0 on vSphere 7.0 and 7.0.1

This issue is fixed in [NSX-T v3.0.3](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center/3.0/rn/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center-303-Release-Notes.html#resolvedissues) 
and [NSX-T v3.1.3](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center/3.1/rn/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center-313-Release-Notes.html#resolvedissues).  

**Symptom**

Your TKGI-provisioned Pods stop after upgrading from NSX-T v3.0.2 to NSX-T v3.1.0 on vSphere 7.0 and 7.0.1.

**Explanation**

For information, see [Issue 2603550: Some VMs are vMotioned and lose network connectivity during UA nodes upgrade]
(https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center/3.1/rn/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center-311-Release-Notes.html#2603550) in the _VMware NSX-T Data Center 3.1.1 Release Notes_.

**Workaround**

To avoid the loss of network connectivity during UA node upgrade, ensure DRS is set to manual mode
during your upgrade from NSX-T v3.0.2 to v3.1.0.

If you upgraded to NSX-T v3.1.0 with DRS in automation mode, run the following on the affected
Pods' control plane VMs to restore Pod connectivity:

```
monit restart ncp
```

For more information about upgrading NSX-T v3.0.2 to NSX-T v3.1.0, see
[Upgrade NSX-T Data Center to v3.0 or v3.1](upgrade-nsxt.html#upgrade-nsxt).

#### <a id="1-13-0-azure-apply-changes"></a> Error: Could Not Execute "Apply-Changes" in Azure Environment

**Symptom**

After clicking **Apply Changes** on the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> tile in an Azure environment,
you experience an error '_...could not execute "apply-changes"..._' with either of the following descriptions:

* _{"errors":{"base":["undefined method 'location' for nil:NilClass"]}}_
* _FailedError.new("Resource Groups in region '#{location}' do not support Availability Zones"))_

For example:

```

```

**Explanation**

The Azure CPI endpoint used by Ops Manager has been changed and 
your installed version of Ops Manager is not compatible with the new endpoint.

**Workaround**

Run the following Ops Manager CLI command:

```
om --skip-ssl-validation --username USERNAME --password PASSWORD --target https://OPSMAN-API curl --silent --path /api/v0/staged/director/verifiers/install_time/IaasConfigurationVerifier -x PUT -d '{ "enabled": false }'
```

Where:

* `USERNAME` is the account to use to run Ops Manager API commands.
* `PASSWORD` is the password for the account.
* `OPSMAN-API` is the IP address for the Ops Manager API

#### <a id="1-13-0-in-windows-notready-nodes"></a> Windows Cluster Nodes Not Deleted After VM Deleted

**Symptom**

After you delete a VM using the management console of your infrastructure provider, you notice a Windows worker node
that had been on that VM is now in a `notReady` state.

**Solution**

1. To identify the leftover node:

    ```
    kubectl get no -o wide
    ```
1. Locate nodes on the returned list that are in a `notReady` state and have the same IP address as another node in the list.
1. To manually delete a `notReady` node:

    ```
    kubectl delete node NODE-NAME
    ```
    Where `NODE-NAME` is the name of the node in the `notReady` state.

#### <a id="1-13-0-oidc-response-header"></a>502 Bad Gateway After OIDC Login

**Symptom**

You experience a "502 Bad Gateway" error from the NSX load balancer after you log in to OIDC.

**Explanation**

A large response header has exceeded your NSX-T load balancer maximum
response header size. The default maximum response header size is 10,240 characters and should
be resized to 50,000.

**Workaround**

If you experience this issue, manually reconfigure your NSX-T `request_header_size`
and `response_header_size` to 50,000 characters.
For information about configuring NSX-T default header sizes,

#### <a id="1-13-0-resizing-worker-nodes"></a> Ingress Controller Statefulset Fails to Start After Resizing Worker Nodes

**Symptom** 

Permissions are removed from your cluster's files and processes after resizing the persistent disk
during a cluster upgrade. The ingress controller statefulset fails to start.

**Explanation** 

When resizing a persistent disk, Bosh migrates the data from the old disk to the new disk but
does not copy the files' extended attributes.

**Workaround**

#### <a id="1-13-0-security-group"></a>Azure Default Security Group Is Not Automatically Assigned to Cluster VMs

**Symptom**

You experience issues when configuring a load balancer for a multi-control plane node Kubernetes cluster or creating a service of type `LoadBalancer`.
Additionally, in the Azure portal, the **VM** > **Networking** page does not display
any inbound and outbound traffic rules for your cluster VMs.

**Explanation**

As part of configuring the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile for Azure, you enter **Default Security Group** in the **Kubernetes Cloud Provider** pane.
When you create a Kubernetes cluster, <%= vars.product_short %> automatically assigns this security group to each VM in the cluster.
However, on Azure the automatic assignment may not occur.

As a result, your inbound and outbound traffic rules defined in the security group are not applied to the cluster VMs.

**Workaround**

If you experience this issue, manually assign the default security group to each VM NIC in your cluster.

<hr>

#### <a id="1-13-0-uuid-length"></a> One Plan ID Longer than Other Plan IDs

**Symptom**

One of your plan IDs is one character longer than your other plan IDs.

**Explanation**

In <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>, each plan has a unique plan ID.
A plan ID is normally a UUID consisting of 32 alphanumeric characters and 4 hyphens.
However, the **Plan 4** ID consists of 33 alphanumeric characters and 4 hyphens.

**Solution**

You can safely configure and use **Plan 4**.
The length of the **Plan 4** ID does not affect the functionality of **Plan 4** clusters.

If you require all plan IDs to have identical length, do not activate or use **Plan 4**.

          --pks=true \
          --read-only=false \
          --force=$force_delete
        ```
    1. Save your edit to `ncp_cleanup`.  
    1. Run `ncp_cleanup`:  
    
        ```
        /var/vcap/jobs/pks-nsx-t-osb-proxy/bin/ncp_cleanup CLUSTER-ID
        ```
        
        Where `CLUSTER-ID` is the cluster's UUID.  
<br>
    1. Restore `ncp_cleanup` to its original state:  
    
        ```
        cp /var/vcap/jobs/pks-nsx-t-osb-proxy/bin/ncp_cleanup.bak   /var/vcap/jobs/pks-nsx-t-osb-proxy/bin/ncp_cleanup

#### <a id="1-13-0-ovsdb-server-failure"></a> Occasionally update-cluster Does Not Complete for Windows Workers

Occasionally, `tkgi update-cluster` hangs while updating a Windows worker node instance and the BOSH task cannot finish and exits.  

**Symptom**

The `ovsdb-server` service has stopped but other processes report that it is running.  

**Explanation**

The `ovsdb-server.pid` file uses the pid for a process that is not the ovsdb-server.

To confirm that this is the root cause for `tkgi update-cluster` to hang:

* To verify the `ovsdb-server` service has actually stopped, run the PowerShell `Get-services` command on the Windows worker node.  
* To verify that other processes report the `ovsdb-server` service is still running:
<br>
    1. Review the ovsdb-server `job-service-wrapper.err.log` log file.  
<br>
        The `job-service-wrapper.err.log` log file is located at:  
        
        ```
        C:\var\vcap\sys\log\openvswitch-windows\ovsdb-server\job-service-wrapper.err.log
        ```
    1. Confirm that after the flushing processes, the log includes an error similar to the following:  

        ```
        Pid-Guard : ovsdb-server is already runing, please stop it first
        At C:\var\vcap\jobs\openvswitch-windows\bin\ovsdb-server_ctl.ps1:30 char:5
        +     Pid-Guard $PIDFILE "ovsdb-server"
        +     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
            + CategoryInfo          : NotSpecified: ( [Write-Error], WriteErrorException
            + FullyQualifiedErrorId : Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.WriteErrorException,Pid-Guard
        ```
* To verify the root cause:
<br>
    1. Run the following PowerShell commands on the Windows worker node:  
    
        ```
        $RUN_DIR = "C:\var\vcap\sys\run\openvswitch-windows"
        $PIDFILE = "$RUN_DIR\ovsdb-server.pid"
        $pid1 = Get-Content $PidFile -First 1
        echo $pid1
        $rst = Get-Process -Id $pid1 -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
        echo $rst
        ```
    1. Confirm the returned `ProcessName` is not `ovsdb-server`.
    
**Workaround**

To resolve this issue for a single Windows worker:  

1. SSH to the affected worker node.  
1. Run the following:   

    ```
    rm C:\var\vcap\sys\run\openvswitch-windows\ovsdb-server.pid
    ```
1. Wait for the `ovsdb-server` process to start.  
1. Confirm the dependent services also start.

#### <a id="1-13-0-ncp-k8s-122"></a> Existing NSX-T Load Balancer Domain Ingress Rules Override Newer Subdomain Ingress Rules

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.13.2](#1-13-2-bug-fixes).

On <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.13 and later, on vSphere with NSX-T, if you apply a load balancer ingress rule to a domain 
before applying ingress rules to subdomains, the domain ingress rule is applied to both the domain and the subdomains, 
and the subdomain ingress rules are ignored.

**Explanation**

With Kubernetes v1.22 and NCP v3.2.0, load balancer ingress rules are applied to domains and subdomains via regex pattern matching 
instead of exact-match pattern matching. 

The load balancer subdomains match the specified domain ingress rule pattern and the subsequent subdomain ingress rules are ignored.  

For more information, see [Resolved Issues](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center/3.2/rn/NSX-Container-Plugin-3203-Release-Notes.html#resolvedissues) in the NSX Container Plugin 3.2.0.3 Release Notes.  

**Workaround**

For newly created ingress rules, specify subdomain rules before rules for their associated domain. 
For example, specify the rules for `api.example.com` and  `mail.example.com` before the rules for `example.com`.

#### <a id="1-13-0-stemcell-tar-support"></a> Deployments Fail on <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Windows Worker-based Kubernetes Clusters after the January 2022 Microsoft Windows Security Patch 

Microsoft changed Microsoft Windows' support for tar file commands in the January 2022 Microsoft Windows security patch.  

Packaging scripts that use tar commands for Windows worker-based Kubernetes Cluster deployments 
can fail after the Microsoft tar command patch update has been applied.  

The BOSH agent used by vSphere stemcells built by stembuild v2019.43 and earlier use tar commands that are no longer supported 
and will fail if the Microsoft Windows security patch has been applied.  


**Workaround**

Stembuild v2019.44 and later include a version of the BOSH agent that does not use unsupported tar commands.  

If you use vSphere stemcells, use Stembuild 2019.44 or later to avoid the BOSH agent tar error.

#### <a id="1-13-0-air-gapped-csi-migration"></a> Cluster Migration to the vSphere CSI Driver Does Not Support Air-Gapped Environments

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.13.2](#1-13-2-bug-fixes).

**Symptom**

After you enable the vSphere CSI Driver and migrate your clusters from VCP to vSphere CSI Driver, 
the validating webhook isn't able to start and reports errors similar to the following:  

```
Warning Failed: Failed to pull image "gcr.io/cloud-provider-vsphere/csi/release/syncer:v2.4.0": rpc error: code = Unknown desc = Error response from daemon: Get "https://gcr.io/v2/": dial tcp: lookup gcr.io on .... no such host

Warning Failed: Error: ErrImagePull

Warning Failed: ImagePullBackOff
```

**Explanation**

In air-gaped environments, the validating webhook is unable to pull the container image from gcr.io. 


**Workaround**

Your environment must be able to access gcr.io during CSI migration.

#### <a id="1-13-0-multiple-coredns"></a> Multiple CoreDNS Pods Might Run On the Same Worker Node after Upgrading a Cluster

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.13.2](#1-13-2-bug-fixes).

**Symptom**

After upgrading a <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> cluster, <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> might run two CoreDNS Pods on the same worker node. 


<hr>

#### <a id="1-13-0-128-antrea-migration"></a> Cluster Migration from Flannel to Antrea Can Fail for Certain CIDR Addresses

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.13.3](#1-13-3-bug-fixes).  

Migrating a cluster from Flannel to Antrea fails if the first octet in the cluster's 
CIDR IP address is greater than `128`. For example: `172.0.0.0/17`.

**Symptom**

After your cluster fails to migrate from Flannel to Antrea:

* An error similar to the following is logged in your cluster creation log:  

    ```
    "code":450001,"message":"Action Failed get_task: Task ... result: 1 of 6 post-start scripts failed. 
    Failed Jobs: deploy-antrea. Successful Jobs: bosh-dns, kube-apiserver, kubernetes-roles, etcd, deploy-proxy-agent."
    ```

* And errors similar to the following are logged in your antrea-deploy folder:

    ```
    /var/vcap/jobs/deploy-antrea/bin/post-start: line 45: 2.88676e+09: syntax error: invalid arithmetic operator (error token is ".88676e+09")

    /var/vcap/jobs/deploy-antrea/bin/post-start: line 50: antrea_svc_ip_int: unbound variable
    ```

#### <a id="1-13-0-fip-ip-reuse"></a> <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Reallocates Network Profile-Allocated FIP Pool Addresses 

**Symptom**

The pre-start script for `tkgi create-cluster` fails and logs floating IP pool allocation errors in the `pre-start.stderr.log` similar to the following:  

```
level=error msg="operation failed with [POST /pools/ip-pools/{pool-id}][409] allocateOrReleaseFromIpPoolConflict  &{RelatedAPIError:{Details: ErrorCode:5141 ErrorData:<nil> ErrorMessage:Requested IP Address ... is already allocated. ModuleName:id-allocation service} RelatedErrors:[]}\n"

level=warning msg="failed to allocate FIP from (pool: ...: [POST /pools/ip-pools/{pool-id}][409] allocateOrReleaseFromIpPoolConflict  &{RelatedAPIError:{Details: ErrorCode:5141 ErrorData:<nil> ErrorMessage:Requested IP Address ... is already allocated. ModuleName:id-allocation service} RelatedErrors:[]}\n"

Error: an error occurred during FIP allocation
```

**Explanation**

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> administrators can allocate floating IP pool IP Addresses in a Network Profile configuration. 
The <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> control plane allocates IP Addresses from the floating IP pool without accounting for the IPs allocated using Network Profiles.  

**Workaround**

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> allocates IP addresses starting from the beginning of a floating IP pool range. 
When configuring a Network Profile, allocate IP Addresses starting at the end of the floating IP pool range instead of those at the beginning.

#### <a id="1-13-0-etcd-3-5-0-data-corruption"></a><a id="etcd-3-5-0-data-corruption"></a>  etcd v3.5.0 Data Corruption Under Heavy Loads

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.13.4](#1-13-4-bug-fixes).  

**Explanation**

The etcd maintainers have announced that etcd v3.5.0 is no longer recommended for production environments due to a data corruption that might occur under heavy loads.   

The corruption might occur silently. <%= vars.recommended_by %> recommends that <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.13 and later administrators 
configure their clusters to detect if the etcd data corruption occurs.  

If your Kubernetes cluster control plane nodes running etcd do not have memory pressure and sigkill has not been interrupted, 
community analysis indicates that there is a very low possibility of data corruption occurring.  

For more information, see [How to detect etcd inconsistency issues in TKGI 1.13.x which could be affected by a known issue in etcd v3.5.x](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/88095) 
in the VMware Tanzu Knowledge Base, and

#### <a id="1-13-0-cve-2022-22965"></a> Spring Application Remote Code Execution Vulnerability CVE-2022-22965

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.13.4](#1-13-4-bug-fixes).  

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.13.0 through v1.13.3 deploy a version of UAA affected by CVE-2022-22965, a Spring application exploit.  

<%= vars.recommended_by %> has confirmed that the vulnerability affects applications running in <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> environments 
and recommends that you implement the workaround steps below as soon as possible.  

**Explanation**

Through the CVE-2022-22965 exploit, Spring MVC and Spring WebFlux JDK 9+ applications running on Tomcat 
as a WAR deployment are vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) via data binding.  

For information on CVE-2022-22965, see [CVE-2022-22965: Spring Framework RCE via Data Binding on JDK 9+](https://tanzu.vmware.com/security/cve-2022-22965) 
or [VMSA-2022-0010](https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2022-0010.html) in the _VMware Security Advisories_ documentation.  

**Workaround**

#### <a id="1-13-0-containerd-sock-error"></a> Cluster Upgrading Fails After Upgrading NSX-T and <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.13.4](#1-13-4-bug-fixes).  

If you patch upgrade NSX-T and then upgrade <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>, 
your cluster upgrades will fail for clusters running the Docker container runtime.  


**Symptom**

Errors similar to the following are logged when your Docker container runtime cluster upgrades fail:  

```
worker/...:/var/vcap/sys/log/docker# cat docker.stderr.log
failed to start daemon: failed to dial "/run/containerd/containerd.sock": failed to dial "/run/containerd/containerd.sock": context deadline exceeded
```

**Explanation**

Docker and kubelet are unable to start because the `vrops-cadvisor` DaemonSet has 
detected that the `/run/containerd/containerd.sock` file does not exist and then 
automatically created it.  

**Workaround**

If you have already upgraded NSX-T and <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>:

1. During cluster upgrading, monitor your worker nodes.  
1. On each worker node:  
    1. Remove `/run/containerd/containerd.sock`.  
    1. Drain and stop all running jobs.  

<br>
If you have not upgraded NSX-T and <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>:

1. Upgrade <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> before updating NSX-T.
1. Upgrade clusters using your normal procedures.

#### <a id="1-13-0-cert-rotate-stops"></a> Certificate Rotation Fails If the Cluster Has a Kubernetes Profile 

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.13.4](#1-13-4-bug-fixes).  

If you run `tkgi rotate-certificates` on a cluster configured with a Kubernetes Profile, 
the certificate rotation process will halt before completing.  


**Symptom**

`tkgi rotate-certificates` halts and logs errors similar to the following when rotating certificates on a cluster configured with a Kubernetes Profile:  

```
org.hibernate.LazyInitializationException: could not initialize proxy io.pivotal.pks.profile.kubernetes.data.KubernetesProfileEntity#... - no Session

#### <a id="1-13-0-logs-growing"></a> kube-apiserver Logs Occupy More Disk Space than Allocated

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.13.5](#1-13-5-bug-fixes).

kube-apiserver logs are regularly compressed and stored for future reference.  

Stale kube-apiserver logs should be deleted when the compressed logs occupy their maximum allocated disk space. 
The compressed kube-apiserver logs are instead being re-compressed, renamed, and moved to a different location.

#### <a id="1-13-0-csi-proxy-issue"></a> Automatic vSphere CSI Driver Integration Ignores Proxy Configuration

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.13.6](#1-13-6-bug-fixes).  

In an environment configured with a proxy, automatic vSphere CSI Driver Integration ignores the configured proxy and fails.  

**Symptom**

In environments configured with a Proxy and automatic **vSphere CSI Driver Integration** enabled, 
the `csi-controller` and `csi-syncer` services log errors similar to the following and fail:  

```
"caller":"vsphere/virtualcenter.go:154","msg":"failed to create new client with err: Post \"...\": dial tcp: lookup ...: no such host"
```

**Workaround**

To configure the vSphere CSI Driver to use your proxy:  

1. SSH to <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Control Plane VM.  

1. Open the `/var/vcap/jobs/csi-controller/bin/csi_controller_ctl` configuration file for editing.  

1. Locate the `start_csi_controller` function in the configuration file:  

    ```
    start_csi_controller()
    {
        ...
        export ...
        export ...
        export ...
        ...
    }
    ```
1. Locate the `export` commands in the `start_csi_controller` function 
and add the following to the group of export commands:  

    ```
    export HTTP_PROXY=HTTP-PROXY
    export HTTPS_PROXY=HTTPS-PROXY
    export NO_PROXY=NO-PROXY
    ```
    
    Where:  
    * `HTTP-PROXY` is the HTTP Proxy that the vSphere CSI Driver must use.  
    * `HTTPS-PROXY` is the HTTPS Proxy that the vSphere CSI Driver must use.  
    * `NO-PROXY` is a list of host names that the vSphere CSI Driver should not use a proxy for.  

1. Restart the `csi_controller`:  

    ```
    sudo monit restart csi_controller
    ```

#### <a id="1-13-0-vm-extensions-toggle"></a> Custom BOSH vm_extensions Configuration Settings Toggle On and Off

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.13.6](#1-13-6-bug-fixes).  

After a failed `tkgi upgrade-cluster` run, your custom BOSH vm_extensions configuration toggles between being present and absent 
depending on when you review the cluster manifest.  


**Explanation**

The VMs that were updated by `tkgi update-cluster` before the failure have manifests with the desired BOSH vm_extensions configuration, 
while those updated afterward do not. 
Re-running `tkgi update-cluster` does not update the manifests in the remaining VMs because the cluster configuration has not changed.

#### <a id="1-13-0-antrea-switch-disabled"></a> Switching Your Default CNI to Antrea is Not Supported

<%# This issue is fixed in [< %= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr % > v1.13.6](#1-13-6-bug-fixes). #%>

You cannot switch your default CNI from Flannel to Antrea during <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> upgrade 
if <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> is running on Ops Manager v2.10.40 or later.

#### <a id="1-13-0-vmdks-deleted-during-migration"></a> VMDKs Are Deleted during Migration from In-Tree Storage to CSI

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.13.6](#1-13-6-bug-fixes).  

While migrating a cluster from using the In-Tree vSphere Storage Driver to the automatically installed vSphere CSI Driver, 
VMDKs attached to worker VMs might be deleted.  

For more information, see [vsphere-csi-driver](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/vsphere-csi-driver/releases/tag/v2.4.2) 
the vSphere CSI Driver Release Notes in GitHub.

#### <a id="1-13-0-docker-image-not-removed"></a> The Docker Image Remains after Switching to the Containerd Container Runtime

<%# This issue is fixed in [< %= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr % > v1.13.8](#1-13-8-bug-fixes). #%>

The Docker image is not automatically removed after successfully switching a cluster from the Docker container runtime to containerd.  

**Workaround**

To remove a Docker image after switching a cluster's container runtime:  

1. Manually remove the cluster's `/var/vcap/store/docker` directory.

#### <a id="management-console-1-13-0-vrli-https"></a> vRealize Log Insight Integration Does Not Support HTTPS Connections

**Symptom**

The <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console integration to vRealize Log Insight does not support connections to the HTTPS port on the vRealize Log Insight server.

**Workaround**

1. Use SSH to log in to the <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console appliance VM.
1. Open the file `/lib/systemd/system/pks-loginsight.service` in a text editor.
1. Add `-e LOG_SERVER_ENABLE_SSL_VERIFY=false`.
1. Set `-e LOG_SERVER_USE_SSL=true`.

    The resulting file should look like the following example:

    ```
    ExecStart=/bin/docker run --privileged --restart=always --network=pks
    -v /var/log/journal:/var/log/journal
    --name=pks-loginsight
    -e TYPE=gear2-vm
    -e LOG_SERVER_HOST=${LOGINSIGHT_HOST}
    -e LOG_SERVER_PORT=${LOGINSIGHT_PORT}
    -e LOG_SERVER_ENABLE_SSL_VERIFY=false
    -e LOG_SERVER_USE_SSL=true
    -e LOG_SERVER_AGENT_ID=${LOGINSIGHT_ID}
    pksoctopus/vrli-journald:v07092019
    ```

1. Save the file and run `systemctl daemon-reload`.
1. To restart the vRealize Log Insight service, run `systemctl restart pks-loginsight.service`.

<%= vars.product_short %> Management Console can now send logs to the HTTPS port on the vRealize Log Insight server.

#### <a id="management-console-1-13-0-vsphere-ha"></a> vSphere HA causes Management Console ovfenv Data Corruption

**Symptom**

If you enable vSphere HA on a cluster, if the TKGI Management Console appliance VM is running on a
host in that cluster, and if the host reboots, vSphere HA recreates a new TKGI Management Console
appliance VM on another host in the cluster. Due to an issue with vSphere HA, the `ovfenv` data for
the newly created appliance VM is corrupted and the new appliance VM does not boot up with the
correct network configuration.

**Workaround**

1. In the vSphere Client, right-click the appliance VM and select **Power** > **Shut Down Guest OS**.
1. Right-click the appliance again and select Edit Settings.
1. Select **VM Options** and click **OK**.
1. Verify under Recent Tasks that a `Reconfigure virtual machine` task has run on the appliance VM.
1. Power on the appliance VM.

<hr>

#### <a id="management-console-1-13-0-k8s-profile"></a> Base64 encoded file arguments are not decoded in Kubernetes profiles

**Symptom**

Some file arguments in Kubernetes profiles are base64 encoded. When the management console displays
the Kubernetes profile, some file arguments are not decoded.

**Workaround**

Run `echo "$content" | base64 --decode`

<hr>

#### <a id="management-console-1-13-0-network-profile"></a> Network profiles not immediately selectable

**Symptom**

If you create network profiles and then try to apply them in the Create Cluster page, the new
profiles are not available for selection.

**Workaround**

Log out of the management console and log back in again.

<hr>

#### <a id="management-console-1-13-0-cluster-summary"></a> Real-Time IP information not displayed for network profiles

**Symptom**

In the cluster summary page, only default IP pool, pod IP block, node IP block values are displayed,
rather than the real-time values from the associated network profile.

**Workaround**

None

<hr>
#### <a id="management-console-1-13-0-harbor-storage-config"></a> Error After Modifying Your Harbor Storage Configuration

**Symptom**

You receive the following error after modifying your existing Harbor installation's storage configuration:

```
Error response from daemon: manifest for ... not found: manifest unknown: manifest unknown
```

**Explanation**

Harbor does not support modifying an existing Harbor installation's storage configuration.

**Workaround**

To modify your Harbor storage configuration,
re-install Harbor. Before starting Harbor, configure the new Harbor installation with the desired configuration.

<hr>
#### <a id="management-console-1-13-0-re-import-windows-stemcell"></a> Windows Stemcells Must be Re-Imported After Upgrading Ops Manager

**Symptom**

After upgrading Ops Manager, your Management Console does not recognize a Windows stemcell imported
when using the prior version of Ops Manager.

**Workaround**

If your Management Console does not recognize a Windows stemcell after upgrading Ops Manager:

1. Re-import your previously imported Windows stemcell. 
2. **Apply Changes** to <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> MC. 

<hr>

#### <a id="management-console-1-13-0-cluster-group-name"></a> Your New Clusters Are Not Shown In Tanzu Mission Control

**Symptom**

After you create a cluster, Tanzu Mission Control does not include the cluster in cluster lists.
You have a "_Resource not found_" error similar to the following in your BOSH logs:

```
Cluster Name in TMC: cluster-1
Cluster Name Prefix: tkgi-my-prefix-
Group Name in TMC: my-prefix-clusters
Cluster Description in TMC: VMware Enterprise PKS Attaching cluster ''tkgi-my-prefix-cluster-1'' to TMC

org id(d859dc9f-g622-426d-8c91-939a9f13dea9)",
"code":5,"message":"Resource not found - clustergroup(my-prefix-clusters)
```

**Explanation**

The cluster group you assign a cluster to must be defined in Tanzu Mission Control
before you assign your cluster to the cluster group in the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Management Console.

**Workaround** 

To resolve the problem, complete the steps in
[Attaching a Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated (TKGI) cluster to Tanzu Mission Control (TMC) fails with "Resource not found - clustergroup(cluster-group-name)"](https://community.pivotal.io/s/article/tkgi-tmc-attach-fail)

**Symptom**

In an NSX-T Data Center - Bring Your Own Topology environment, <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> MC displays the following error 
if you reconfigure your TKGI deployment DNS after installing TKGI:  

```
Input validation failed Validation errors found: Fail to parse network : invalid CIDR address:
```

**Workaround**  

To reconfigure your TKGI Deployment DNS:

1. Open the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> deployment YAML in the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> MC YAML Editor.  
1. To modify the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Deployment DNS, modify the `dep_dns` field.  
1. To modify the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Deployment CIDR, modify the `dep_network_cidr` field. 
Provide any CIDR that does not contain the Deployment DNS IP.  
<br>
    For example:  

    ```
    network:
      dep_dns:192.168.111.155
      dep_network_cidr: "80.0.0.1/24"
    ```
    The new CIDR will not affect your original CIDR configuration.   

1. Click **Apply Configuration**.
