<a id="1-15-0-component-updates"></a> &#42; Components marked with an asterisk have been updated.  
&#42;&#42; VCF v4.4 is supported but has not been tested with <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.15.0.  



### <a id="1-15-0-upgrade"></a>Upgrade Path

The supported upgrade paths to <%= vars.product_short %> v1.15.0 are from 
<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.14.2 and earlier <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.14 patches.  


### <a id="1-15-0-breaking-changes"></a>Breaking Changes

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.15.0 has the following breaking changes:

* Upgrades Kubernetes to v1.24:  

    * Removes support for Dockershim.   
<br> 
        Kubernetes support for the Docker container runtime has been entirely removed. 
        <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.15 supports the containerd container runtime. 
        All existing <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Kubernetes clusters using the Docker container runtime 
        are switched to the containerd container runtime during the upgrade to <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.15.  

        <p class="note warning"><strong>Warning</strong>: During the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.15 upgrade, 
            cluster workloads on clusters that switch from using the Docker container runtime to containerd will experience downtime.  
            <br>
            Cluster workloads do not experience downtime when <code>tkgi update-cluster</code> is used to switch container runtimes.
            To avoid workload downtime, <%= vars.recommended_by %> recommends that you 
            switch your Docker container runtime clusters to containerd before upgrading to <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.15. 
            For more information, 
            see <a href="#1-15-0-coredns-downtime">Cluster Workloads Experience Downtime While Upgrading and Switching Container Runtimes</a> below.
        </p>  
     
        The tkgi cli `create-cluster` and `update-cluster` commands 
        no longer support the `runtime` and `lock_container_runtime` flags in configuration files.  
        
    
    * On public clouds, support for in-tree storage volumes has been removed.  
<br> 
        Migration from public cloud in-tree storage volumes to the CSI driver is required.  
        
        If your TKGI environment is on a public cloud, you must install the required CSI driver on your clusters 
        before upgrading to <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.15.0. 
        For more information on migrating in-tree storage volumes to the CSI driver, 
        see [Install the Public Cloud CSI Driver Before Upgrading](checklist.html#install-csi-driver-public-cloud) 
        in _Upgrade Preparation Checklist for Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition_.  
        
        For information on using a public cloud CSI Driver with <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Kubernetes clusters, 
        see [Limitations on Using a Public Cloud CSI Driver](#1-15-0-csi-driver-limits) below.  
        
    For more information about Kubernetes v1.24, see 
    [Kubernetes Removals and Deprecations In 1.24](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2022/04/07/upcoming-changes-in-kubernetes-1-24/) 
    in the Kubernetes documentation.  

* fluent-bit `sink-resources` requires a CA certificate with a SAN field:

    * The custom CA certificate used to secure fluent-bit log forwarding connections must include a `SAN` field. 
    If the certificate does not include a `SAN` field, 
    fluent-bit will not send logs and will record the following fluent-bit Pod log error:  

    ```
    build tls conn err: x509: certificate relies on legacy Common Name field, use SANs instead
    ```

#### <a id="1-15-0-renamed-ops-man"></a> TKGI MC Unable to Manage TKGI after Restoring the TKGI Control Plane from Backup

**Symptom**

After you restore Ops Manager and the <%= vars.control_plane %> VM from backup,
<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> functions normally, but your <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> MC tabs
include the following error: "...product 'pivotal-container service' is not deployed...".

**Explanation**

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> MC is associated with an Ops Manager with a specific name.
If you rename Ops Manager with a new name while restoring, your <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> MC
will not recognize the restored Ops Manager and cannot manage it.

<hr>

#### <a id="1-15-0-hyperbus-error"></a> Kubernetes Pods on NSX-T Become Stuck in a Creating State

**Symptom**

The pods in your <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Kubernetes clusters on NSX-T become stuck in a
creating state.
The connections between nsx-node-agent and hyperbus repeatedly close, log
`Couldn't connect to 'tcp://...' (error: 111-Connection refused)`, and have a status of
`COMMUNICATION_ERROR`.

**Explanation**

For information and workaround steps for this Known Issue, see
[Issue 2795268: Connection between nsx-node-agent and hyperbus flips and Kubernetes pod is stuck at creating state](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center/3.1/rn/NSX-Container-Plugin-312-Release-Notes.html#RNA_11559)

#### <a id="1-15-0-azure-apply-changes"></a> Error: Could Not Execute "Apply-Changes" in Azure Environment

**Symptom**

After clicking **Apply Changes** on the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> tile in an Azure environment,
you experience an error '_...could not execute "apply-changes"..._' with either of the following descriptions:

* _{"errors":{"base":["undefined method 'location' for nil:NilClass"]}}_
* _FailedError.new("Resource Groups in region '#{location}' do not support Availability Zones"))_

For example:

```

```

**Explanation**

The Azure CPI endpoint used by Ops Manager has been changed and
your installed version of Ops Manager is not compatible with the new endpoint.

**Workaround**

Run the following Ops Manager CLI command:

```
om --skip-ssl-validation --username USERNAME --password PASSWORD --target https://OPSMAN-API curl --silent --path /api/v0/staged/director/verifiers/install_time/IaasConfigurationVerifier -x PUT -d '{ "enabled": false }'
```

Where:

* `USERNAME` is the account to use to run Ops Manager API commands.
* `PASSWORD` is the password for the account.
* `OPSMAN-API` is the IP address for the Ops Manager API

#### <a id="1-15-0-in-windows-notready-nodes"></a> Windows Cluster Nodes Not Deleted After VM Deleted

**Symptom**

After you delete a VM using the management console of your infrastructure provider, you notice a Windows worker node
that had been on that VM is now in a `notReady` state.

**Solution**

1. To identify the leftover node:

    ```
    kubectl get no -o wide
    ```
1. Locate nodes on the returned list that are in a `notReady` state and have the same IP address as another node in the list.
1. To manually delete a `notReady` node:

    ```
    kubectl delete node NODE-NAME
    ```
    Where `NODE-NAME` is the name of the node in the `notReady` state.

#### <a id="1-15-0-oidc-response-header"></a>502 Bad Gateway After OIDC Login

**Symptom**

You experience a "502 Bad Gateway" error from the NSX load balancer after you log in to OIDC.

**Explanation**

A large response header has exceeded your NSX-T load balancer maximum
response header size. The default maximum response header size is 10,240 characters and should
be resized to 50,000.

**Workaround**

If you experience this issue, manually reconfigure your NSX-T `request_header_size`
and `response_header_size` to 50,000 characters.

#### <a id="1-15-0-security-group"></a>Azure Default Security Group Is Not Automatically Assigned to Cluster VMs

**Symptom**

You experience issues when configuring a load balancer for a multi-control plane node Kubernetes cluster or creating a service of type `LoadBalancer`.
Additionally, in the Azure portal, the **VM** > **Networking** page does not display
any inbound and outbound traffic rules for your cluster VMs.

**Explanation**

As part of configuring the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile for Azure, you enter **Default Security Group** in the **Kubernetes Cloud Provider** pane.
When you create a Kubernetes cluster, <%= vars.product_short %> automatically assigns this security group to each VM in the cluster.
However, on Azure the automatic assignment may not occur.

As a result, your inbound and outbound traffic rules defined in the security group are not applied to the cluster VMs.

**Workaround**

If you experience this issue, manually assign the default security group to each VM NIC in your cluster.

A plan ID is normally a UUID consisting of 32 alphanumeric characters and 4 hyphens.
However, the **Plan 4** ID consists of 33 alphanumeric characters and 4 hyphens.

**Solution**

You can safely configure and use **Plan 4**.
The length of the **Plan 4** ID does not affect the functionality of **Plan 4** clusters.

If you require all plan IDs to have identical length, do not activate or use **Plan 4**.

#### <a id="1-15-0-ovsdb-server-failure"></a> Occasionally update-cluster Does Not Complete for Windows Workers

Occasionally, `tkgi update-cluster` hangs while updating a Windows worker node instance and the BOSH task cannot finish and exits.

**Symptom**

The `ovsdb-server` service has stopped but other processes report that it is running.

**Explanation**

The `ovsdb-server.pid` file uses the pid for a process that is not the ovsdb-server.

To confirm that this is the root cause for `tkgi update-cluster` to hang:

* To verify the `ovsdb-server` service has actually stopped, run the PowerShell `Get-services` command on the Windows worker node.
* To verify that other processes report the `ovsdb-server` service is still running:
<br>
    1. Review the ovsdb-server `job-service-wrapper.err.log` log file.
<br>
        The `job-service-wrapper.err.log` log file is located at:

        ```
        C:\var\vcap\sys\log\openvswitch-windows\ovsdb-server\job-service-wrapper.err.log
        ```
    1. Confirm that after the flushing processes, the log includes an error similar to the following:

        ```
        Pid-Guard : ovsdb-server is already runing, please stop it first
        At C:\var\vcap\jobs\openvswitch-windows\bin\ovsdb-server_ctl.ps1:30 char:5
        +     Pid-Guard $PIDFILE "ovsdb-server"
        +     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
            + CategoryInfo          : NotSpecified: ( [Write-Error], WriteErrorException
            + FullyQualifiedErrorId : Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.WriteErrorException,Pid-Guard
        ```
* To verify the root cause:
<br>
    1. Run the following PowerShell commands on the Windows worker node:

        ```
        $RUN_DIR = "C:\var\vcap\sys\run\openvswitch-windows"
        $PIDFILE = "$RUN_DIR\ovsdb-server.pid"
        $pid1 = Get-Content $PidFile -First 1
        echo $pid1
        $rst = Get-Process -Id $pid1 -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
        echo $rst
        ```
    1. Confirm the returned `ProcessName` is not `ovsdb-server`.

**Workaround**

To resolve this issue for a single Windows worker:

1. SSH to the affected worker node.
1. Run the following:

    ```
    rm C:\var\vcap\sys\run\openvswitch-windows\ovsdb-server.pid
    ```
1. Wait for the `ovsdb-server` process to start.
1. Confirm the dependent services also start.

**Symptom**

The pre-start script for `tkgi create-cluster` fails and logs floating IP pool allocation errors in the `pre-start.stderr.log` similar to the following:

```
level=error msg="operation failed with [POST /pools/ip-pools/{pool-id}][409] allocateOrReleaseFromIpPoolConflict  &{RelatedAPIError:{Details: ErrorCode:5141 ErrorData:<nil> ErrorMessage:Requested IP Address ... is already allocated. ModuleName:id-allocation service} RelatedErrors:[]}\n"

#### <a id="1-15-0-coredns-downtime"></a> Cluster Workloads Experience Downtime While Upgrading and Switching Container Runtimes

The workloads on a cluster will experience a period of downtime if the cluster runtime is automatically switched from Docker to containerd 
during a <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> upgrade.  

**Explanation**  

By default, clusters are switched from the Docker container runtime to containerd while upgrading <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> to a newer <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> version.  

If a <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> upgrade switches a cluster container runtime, the workloads on that cluster will experience a period of downtime.  

Administrators have the option to switch container runtimes manually before upgrading <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>. 
Administrators can also tag a cluster to not switch container runtimes automatically during a <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> upgrade.  

**Workaround**

To avoid workload downtime, manually switch the cluster's container runtime to containerd before upgrading to <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.14
or configure the cluster so that the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> upgrade does not switch the cluster's container runtime.  

If you must allow the container runtime switch to occur during a <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> upgrade, 
avoid workload downtime by completing the following steps before upgrading to <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.14:  

1. Pull down the coreDNS image used in your <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.13 Kubernetes clusters.  

    * If you are upgrading <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> from v1.13.2 through v1.13.6 to <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.14.0 and later:  
    
        ```
        docker pull projects.registry.vmware.com/tkg/coredns:v1.8.4_vmware.7
        ```  
        
    * If you are upgrading from <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.13.0 or v1.13.1 to <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.14.0 and later:  
    
        1. SSH to one of the worker nodes.  
        1. Use the following `alias docker` command:  
        
            ```
            alias docker="/var/vcap/packages/docker/bin/docker --host unix:///var/vcap/sys/run/docker/docker.sock"
            ```
            
        1. Export the coreDNS image using [`docker save`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/save/).  
            
1. Upload the coreDNS image to your custom image registry.  
1. Modify the coreDNS deployment to use the uploaded image. 
Repeat this step for all of the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Kubernetes clusters with workloads that should remain up during the upgrade.  
1. Upgrade <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> from v1.13 to <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.14.  

    During worker upgrades the coreDNS image in the custom image registry is available, avoiding coreDNS downtime. 
    After upgrading a cluster, the workers use the coreDNS version installed by the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> upgrade.

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.15.1](#1-15-1-bug-fixes). 

While updating or upgrading a Windows Worker cluster that uses the containerd container runtime, some of the cluster's nodes can become unresponsive. 
During the cluster update or upgrade, the node drain step for the cluster's nodes can time out and not finish.  

**Symptom**

While updating or upgrading a Windows Worker cluster, the drain step for some nodes hangs for an extended period, and the nodes enter an `unresponsive agent` state. 
The update or upgrade process eventually logs the error `Error: Timed out sending 'get_task' to instance` for the `executing drain` step.

#### <a id="1-15-0-large-docker-timeout"></a> Timeout While Switching Container Runtimes If the Docker Directory Is Too Large 

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.15.1](#1-15-1-bug-fixes). 

Switching a cluster's container runtime from Docker to containerd can timeout and fail 
if the Docker directory contains many files.  

**Description**

A timeout occurs during the `remove Docker` step while switching a cluster's container runtime 
from Docker to containerd if the Docker directory contains too many files to delete within 
the 180-second timeout interval.  

**Workaround**

To work around this issue:  

1. Manually remove the `/var/vcap/store/docker` directory.  
1. Re-start the process that stopped due to the time out.

#### <a id="1-15-0-pv-not-attached-to-new-node"></a> Persistent Volumes Fail to Detach from Nodes

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.15.1](#1-15-1-bug-fixes). 

If a Pod is recreated in a new instance node, the persistent volume might remain attached to the old node.  

**Symptom**  

A persistent volume remains attached to an old node, and attachment errors similar to the following are logged:  

```
Warning FailedMount... kubelet Unable to attach or mount volumes: unmounted volumes=..., unattached volumes=...: timed out waiting for the condition
Warning FailedMount... kubelet Unable to attach or mount volumes: unmounted volumes=..., unattached volumes=...: timed out waiting for the condition

#### <a id="1-15-0-crashloopbackoff-after-containerd"></a> Pods on Clusters Using the containerd-Runtime Enter a CrashLoopBackOff State
   
This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.15.1](#1-15-1-bug-fixes).  

Pods in a cluster that has been switched from the Docker container runtime to containerd might enter a CrashLoopBackOff state. 
If the container runtime switch is part of a cluster upgrade, the upgrade halts.  

**Symptom**

The Pods that have entered the CrashLoopBackOff state log the following:

```
Warning FailedCreatePodSandBox... Failed to create pod sandbox: rpc error: code = 
Unknown desc = failed to create containerd task: failed to start shim: 
write /var/vcap/sys/run/containerd/io.containerd.runtime.v2.task/.../config.json: 
no space left on device: unknown
```

The `/var/vcap/data/sys/run` directory on the instance node with Pods that have entered the CrashLoopBackOff state is full.

#### <a id="1-15-0-container-migration-image-access"></a> Workload Downtime after Switching Container Runtimes from Docker to containerd

This issue is fixed in [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.15.1](#1-15-1-bug-fixes).  

Pods on updated worker nodes do not automatically restart after switching a cluster's container runtime from Docker to containerd.

**Explanation**

The Docker image is not available to containerd after successfully switching a cluster's container runtime to containerd. 
Pods on the cluster crash before a new YAML configuration for containerd can be applied.

#### <a id="management-console-1-15-0-vrli-https"></a> vRealize Log Insight Integration Does Not Support HTTPS Connections

**Symptom**

The <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console integration to vRealize Log Insight does not support connections to the HTTPS port on the vRealize Log Insight server.

**Workaround**

1. Use SSH to log in to the <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console appliance VM.
1. Open the file `/lib/systemd/system/pks-loginsight.service` in a text editor.
1. Add `-e LOG_SERVER_ENABLE_SSL_VERIFY=false`.
1. Set `-e LOG_SERVER_USE_SSL=true`.

    The resulting file should look like the following example:

    ```
    ExecStart=/bin/docker run --privileged --restart=always --network=pks
    -v /var/log/journal:/var/log/journal
    --name=pks-loginsight
    -e TYPE=gear2-vm
    -e LOG_SERVER_HOST=${LOGINSIGHT_HOST}
    -e LOG_SERVER_PORT=${LOGINSIGHT_PORT}
    -e LOG_SERVER_ENABLE_SSL_VERIFY=false
    -e LOG_SERVER_USE_SSL=true
    -e LOG_SERVER_AGENT_ID=${LOGINSIGHT_ID}
    pksoctopus/vrli-journald:v07092019
    ```

1. Save the file and run `systemctl daemon-reload`.
1. To restart the vRealize Log Insight service, run `systemctl restart pks-loginsight.service`.

<%= vars.product_short %> Management Console can now send logs to the HTTPS port on the vRealize Log Insight server.

#### <a id="management-console-1-15-0-vsphere-ha"></a> vSphere HA causes Management Console ovfenv Data Corruption

**Symptom**

If you enable vSphere HA on a cluster, if the TKGI Management Console appliance VM is running on a
host in that cluster, and if the host reboots, vSphere HA recreates a new TKGI Management Console
appliance VM on another host in the cluster. Due to an issue with vSphere HA, the `ovfenv` data for
the newly created appliance VM is corrupted and the new appliance VM does not boot up with the
correct network configuration.

**Workaround**

1. In the vSphere Client, right-click the appliance VM and select **Power** > **Shut Down Guest OS**.
1. Right-click the appliance again and select Edit Settings.
1. Select **VM Options** and click **OK**.
1. Verify under Recent Tasks that a `Reconfigure virtual machine` task has run on the appliance VM.
1. Power on the appliance VM.

#### <a id="management-console-1-15-0-k8s-profile"></a> Base64 encoded file arguments are not decoded in Kubernetes profiles

**Symptom**

Some file arguments in Kubernetes profiles are base64 encoded. When the management console displays
the Kubernetes profile, some file arguments are not decoded.

**Workaround**

Run `echo "$content" | base64 --decode`

<hr>

#### <a id="management-console-1-15-0-network-profile"></a> Network profiles not immediately selectable

**Symptom**

If you create network profiles and then try to apply them in the Create Cluster page, the new
profiles are not available for selection.

**Workaround**

Log out of the management console and log back in again.

<hr>

#### <a id="management-console-1-15-0-cluster-summary"></a> Real-Time IP information not displayed for network profiles

**Symptom**

In the cluster summary page, only default IP pool, pod IP block, node IP block values are displayed,
rather than the real-time values from the associated network profile.

**Workaround**

None

<hr>
#### <a id="management-console-1-15-0-harbor-storage-config"></a> Error After Modifying Your Harbor Storage Configuration

**Symptom**

You receive the following error after modifying your existing Harbor installation's storage configuration:

```
Error response from daemon: manifest for ... not found: manifest unknown: manifest unknown
```

**Explanation**

Harbor does not support modifying an existing Harbor installation's storage configuration.

**Workaround**

To modify your Harbor storage configuration,
re-install Harbor. Before starting Harbor, configure the new Harbor installation with the desired configuration.

<hr>

#### <a id="management-console-1-15-0-re-import-windows-stemcell"></a> Windows Stemcells Must be Re-Imported After Upgrading Ops Manager

**Symptom**

After upgrading Ops Manager, your Management Console does not recognize a Windows stemcell imported
when using the prior version of Ops Manager.

**Workaround**

If your Management Console does not recognize a Windows stemcell after upgrading Ops Manager:

1. Re-import your previously imported Windows stemcell.
2. **Apply Changes** to <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> MC.

<hr>

#### <a id="management-console-1-15-0-cluster-group-name"></a> Your New Clusters Are Not Shown In Tanzu Mission Control

**Symptom**

After you create a cluster, Tanzu Mission Control does not include the cluster in cluster lists.
You have a "_Resource not found_" error similar to the following in your BOSH logs:

```
Cluster Name in TMC: cluster-1
Cluster Name Prefix: tkgi-my-prefix-
Group Name in TMC: my-prefix-clusters
Cluster Description in TMC: VMware Enterprise PKS Attaching cluster ''tkgi-my-prefix-cluster-1'' to TMC
Fetching token successful
request POST:/v1alpha1/clusters,
response 404 Not Found:{"error":"Resource not found - clustergroup(my-prefix-clusters)
org id(d859dc9f-g622-426d-8c91-939a9f13dea9)",
"code":5,"message":"Resource not found - clustergroup(my-prefix-clusters)
```

**Explanation**

The cluster group you assign a cluster to must be defined in Tanzu Mission Control
before you assign your cluster to the cluster group in the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Management Console.

**Workaround**

To resolve the problem, complete the steps in
[Attaching a Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated (TKGI) cluster to Tanzu Mission Control (TMC) fails with "Resource not found - clustergroup(cluster-group-name)"](https://community.pivotal.io/s/article/tkgi-tmc-attach-fail)
in the VMware Tanzu Knowledge Base.
