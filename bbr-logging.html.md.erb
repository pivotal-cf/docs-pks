This topic provides information about BBR logging. Use this information when troubleshooting a failed backup or restore using BBR.

## <a id='logging'></a>Understand Logging

By default, BBR displays the following:

* The backup and restore scripts that it finds  
* When it starts or finishes a stage, such as `pre-backup scripts` or `backup scripts`  
* When the process is complete  
* When any error occurs

BBR writes any errors associated with stack traces to a file in of the form `bbr-TIMESTAMP.err.log` in the current directory.

If more logging is needed, use the optional `--debug` flag to print the following information:

* Logs about the API requests made to the BOSH server  
* All commands executed on remote instances  
* All commands executed on local environment  
* Standard in and standard out streams for the backup and restore scripts when they are executed
