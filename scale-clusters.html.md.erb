This topic explains how to scale an existing cluster horizontally by adding worker nodes and vertically by changing the size of the node VMs.

<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING</strong>: Do not change the number of master/etcd nodes 
for any plan that was used to create currently-running clusters. 
<%= vars.product_short %> does not support changing the number of master/etcd nodes for plans 
with existing clusters.
</p>
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: To change the default number of worker nodes created in new clusters, 
  change your plan's <strong>Worker Node Instances</strong> setting. 
  For more information, see <a href="installing-pks-azure.html#plans">Plans</a>

## <a id="scale-horizontal"></a>Scale Horizontally by Changing the Number of Worker Nodes Using the PKS CLI

Follow the steps below to scale an existing cluster using the PKS CLI by increasing or decreasing the number of worker nodes.

1. <%= partial 'login-pks-api' %>

1. To view the current number of worker nodes in your cluster, run the following command:

    ```
    pks cluster CLUSTER-NAME
    ```
    Where `CLUSTER-NAME` is the name of your cluster.

1. Run the following command:

    ```
    pks resize CLUSTER-NAME --num-nodes NUMBER-OF-WORKER-NODES
    ```
    Where:
    * `CLUSTER-NAME` is the name of your cluster.
    * `NUMBER-OF-WORKER-NODES` is the number of worker nodes you want to set for the cluster.
	   * To scale down your existing cluster, enter a number lower than the current number of worker
        nodes. 
		* To scale up your existing cluster, enter a number higher than the current number of worker
        nodes. The maximum number of worker nodes you can set is configured in the **Plan** pane of
        the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile in Pivotal Ops Manager.

	 For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ pks resize my-cluster --num-nodes 5
    </pre>
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> This command may roll additional virtual machines in the
    cluster, which can affect workloads if the worker nodes are at capacity.</p>

## <a id="scale-vertical"></a>Scale Vertically by Changing Cluster Node VM Sizes in the PKS Tile

You can scale an existing cluster vertically by changing the size of the master or worker node VMs. When this is done, BOSH will recreate the VMs sequentially, one cluster at a time, and one node after another within the cluster. See [VM Sizing for PKS Clusters](vm-sizing.html) for more information.

To change the size of a Kubernetes cluster node VM, complete the following steps:

1. Log in to Ops Manager.
1. Select the PKS tile.
1. Select the plan that is in use by the cluster(s) you want to resize.
1. To change the VM size:
  - For Master nodes, select the desired VM size from the **Master/ETCD VM Type** menu.
  - For Worker nodes, select the desired VM size from the **Worker VM Type** menu.
<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> See <a href="vm-sizing.html#node-sizing-custom">Customize Master and Worker Node VM Size and Type</a> for information on creating a custom VM size for use with a PKS cluster.</p>
1. Click **Save** to preserve tile changes.
1. At the **Installation Dashboard**, click **Review Pending Changes**.
1. For the PKS tile, expand the **ERRANDS** list.
1. Select the **Update all clusters errand** if it is not already selected. You must ensure that **Update all clusters errand** is selected so that the cluster deployment manifest is regenerated after the plan is updated.
