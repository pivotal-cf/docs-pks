title: Adding an OIDC Provider
owner: TKGI
---

This topic explains how you can use a Kubernetes profile in <%= vars.product_short %> (<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>) to override the default Identity Provider (IDP).

## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

The <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> **UAA** pane configures a default IDP for all the clusters that <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> creates.
You can use a Kubernetes profile to override this default IDP.  

The Kubernetes profile applies a custom OIDC-compatible IDP to a cluster by deploying an OIDC connector as a service pod on the cluster.

The following diagram provides an overview of how this configuration works:

![OIDC diagram](images/oidc-dex.png)

* **OIDC service provider cluster** with external hostname `dex-host.example.com`
  - Hosts a dex pod that accesses the LDAP server
  - Publishes its OIDC service to `dex.example.com:32000`
* **OIDC Kubernetes profile** has the URL of the OIDC service
* **Host cluster** with external hostname `cluster.example.com`
  - Uses the OIDC Kubernetes profile
  - Calls the OIDC service at `dex.example.com:32000` to authenticate the user
  whenever a user requests an app hosted on the cluster

The Kubernetes profile in this topic deploys [dex](https://github.com/dexidp/dex) as an OIDC provider, but you can use any OIDC service.

For more information and other uses of Kubernetes profiles, see [Using Kubernetes Profiles](./k8s-profiles.html).

## <a id='prerequisites'></a>Prerequisites

To use UAA as your OIDC provider, the <%= vars.control_plane %> **Certificate to secure the <%= vars.control_plane %>** field 
on the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> tile must be a proper certificate chain and have a SAN field. 
For more information, see configuring [<%= vars.control_plane %>](installing-vsphere.html#tkgi-api) 
in the _Installing <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>_ topic for your IaaS.  


## <a id='process'></a>Configure a Custom OIDC Provider

To configure a custom OIDC provider for <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> clusters, complete the following:

1. [Set Up Dex Workload](#dex)
1. [Set Up Communication Path](#paths)
1. [Deploy and Expose Dex](#deploy)
1. [Create Kubernetes Profile](#profile)
1. [Create Cluster](#cluster)
1. [Test Cluster Access](#test)

### <a id='dex'></a>Set Up Dex Workload

To configure [dex](https://github.com/dexidp/dex) as an OIDC provider for an LDAP directory:  

1. Create a cluster in <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> for installing dex as a pod:

    ```
    tkgi create-cluster dex -p small -e dex-host.example.com
    ```

1. Run `tkgi cluster` for the cluster and record its `Kubernetes Master IP` address.  
<br>
    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ tkgi cluster dex  
    <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Version:             1.9.0-build.1  
    Name:                    dex  
    K8s Version:             1.24.3  
    Plan Name:               small  
  
    UUID:                    dbe1d880-478f-4d0d-bb2e-0da3d9641f0d  
    Last Action:             CREATE  
    Last Action State:       succeeded  
    Last Action Description: Instance provisioning completed  
    Kubernetes Master Host:  dex-host.example.com  
    Kubernetes Master Port:  8443  
    Worker Nodes:            1  
    Kubernetes Master IP(s): 10.0.11.11  
    Network Profile Name:  
    Kubernetes Profile Name:  
    Tags:  
    </pre>

1. Add the `Kubernetes Master IP` address to your local `/etc/hosts` file.

1. Populate your `~/.kube/config` with context for dex:

    ```
    tkgi get-credentials dex
    ```

1. Switch to the `admin` context of the dex cluster:

    ```
    kubectl config use-context dex
    ```

1. To deploy a dex workload on a Kubernetes cluster, follow the steps in 
[Deploying dex on Kubernetes](https://github.com/dexidp/website/blob/main/content/docs/kubernetes.md#deploying-dex-on-kubernetes) 
in the dex GitHub repo.  
    * To create a dex deployment that connects to an LDAP server, 
    see [dex/examples/ldap/config-ldap.yaml](https://github.com/dexidp/dex/blob/master/examples/ldap/config-ldap.yaml) in the dex OIDC GitHub repository.  
<% if vars.product_version == "COMMENTED - PKS-6377"  %>
    * To create a dex deployment that connects to an LDAP server, 
    configure a `dex.yaml` file using the format in [Example dex YAML File](#example-dex-yaml) below.  
<% end %>

### <a id='paths'></a>Set Up Communication Path

To set up `\etcd\hosts` and TLS so that clusters can access dex securely:  

1. Add the `/etc/hosts` entry for the public IP and the hostname
    `dex.example.com` on your local workstation.
    This lets you retrieve a token to access your OIDC-profile cluster later.
    
    ```
    10.0.11.11 dex.example.com
    ```

1. To generate TLS assets for the dex deployment, complete the steps in 
    [Generate TLS assets](https://github.com/dexidp/website/blob/main/content/docs/kubernetes.md#generate-tls-assets) 
    in the dex documentation.

1. To add the generated TLS assets to the cluster as a secret, complete the steps in 
[Create cluster secrets](https://github.com/dexidp/website/blob/main/content/docs/kubernetes.md#create-cluster-secrets) 
in the dex documentation.

### <a id='deploy'></a>Deploy and Expose Dex

To run dex as a local service within a pod and exposes its endpoint via an IP address:   

1. On a Kubernetes cluster, deploy dex using the instructions above.  

1. Wait for the deployment to succeed.  

1. Expose the dex deployment as a service named `dex-service`:

    ```
    kubectl expose deployment dex --type=LoadBalancer --name=dex-service
    ```

    For example:  
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ kubectl expose deployment dex --type=LoadBalancer --name=dex-service
    \> service/dex-service exposed
    </pre>

1. This should create a dex service with a public IP address that clusters can use as an OIDC issuer URL. Retrieve the IP address by running:
    
    ```
    kubectl get services dex-service
    ```

1. Add the IP of the dex service to your `/etc/hosts`:

    ```
    35.222.29.10 dex.example.com
    ```
    * Ensure that you map the dex service to `dex.example.com`,
    which the dex binary expects as `issuer_url` and for TLS handshakes.
    * For this example, we set up the issuer URL as
    `https://dex.example.com:32000`.

### <a id='profile'></a>Create Kubernetes Profile

To create a Kubernetes profile that lets a cluster's `kube-api-server` connect to the dex service:

1. Create a Kubernetes profile `/tmp/profile.json` containing your custom OIDC settings under the `kube-apiserver` component.  
<br>
    For example:  

    ```
    $ cat /tmp/profile.json  
    {  
       "name": "oidc-config",  
       "description": "Kubernetes profile with OIDC configuration",  
       "customizations": [  
          {  
             "component": "kube-apiserver",  
             "arguments": {  
                "oidc-client-id": "example-app",  
                "oidc-issuer-url": "https://dex.example.com:32000",  
                "oidc-username-claim": "email"  
             },  
             "file-arguments": {  
                "oidc-ca-file": "/tmp/oidc-ca.pem"  
             }  
          }  
       ]  
    }  
    ```
    
    Of all the supported `kube-apiserver` flags, the following are specific to OIDC:  
    
    * In the `arguments` block:  
        * `oidc-issuer-url`: Set this to `"https://dex.example.com:32000"`.  
        * `oidc-client-id`  
        * `oidc-username-claim`: Set this to `"email"` for testing with the example app [below](#test).  
        * `oidc-groups-claim`  
    * In the `file-arguments` block:  
        * `oidc-ca-file`: Set this to a path in the local file system that contains a CA certificate file. 
        The certificate must be a proper certificate chain and have a SAN field.  
        
    For more information on `kube-apiserver` flags, see 
    [kube-apiserver](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-apiserver/) 
    in the Kubernetes documentation.  

1. Create the profile:

    ```
    tkgi create-kubernetes-profile /tmp/profile.json
    ```

In the example above, the file-path `/tmp/oidc-ca.pem` points to a CA certificate on the local file system, 
and the `tkgi create-kubernetes-profile` command sends this certificate to the API server when it creates the profile.

### <a id='cluster'></a>Create Cluster

To create a cluster using the Kubernetes profile created above:

1. Run the following:  

    ```
    tkgi create-cluster cluster-with-custom-oidc -e cluster.example.com -p small --kubernetes-profile oid-config
    ```
    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Use only lowercase characters when naming your cluster 
    if you manage your clusters with Tanzu Mission Control (TMC). Clusters with names that include an uppercase character cannot be attached to TMC.
    </p>

1. Confirm the cluster has custom OIDC settings from the profile.  

### <a id='test'></a>Test Cluster Access

To test that the cluster uses the OIDC provider to control access, 
install an app, generate an ID token, and test the cluster.  

You can use an example app from the dex repo or test with a full-fledged application, such as [Gangway](https://github.com/heptiolabs/gangway), instead of the example app.

To test that the cluster uses the OIDC provider: 

1. To install an example app, complete the steps to install the `example-app` in 
[Logging into the cluster](https://github.com/dexidp/website/blob/main/content/docs/kubernetes.md#logging-into-the-cluster) in the dex documentation.  

1. Run the dex example app:

    ```
    ./bin/example-app --issuer https://dex.example.com:32000
    --issuer-root-ca /tmp/ca.pem
    ```
    - The example app only provides the `email` scope.

1. To fetch the token, complete the steps to generate an ID token in 
[Logging into the cluster](https://github.com/dexidp/website/blob/main/content/docs/kubernetes.md#logging-into-the-cluster) 
in the dex documentation.

1. Log in using the **Log in with Email** option and enter the email and password of an account in your OIDC IDP.  

<% if vars.product_version == "COMMENTED"  %>
<%#  ****THIS TEXT AND IMAGE CAN ONLY CAUSE CONFUSION

This example uses email `alana@test.com` and password `password`.

    ![Test app pane: 'Authenticate for' field, 'Extra scopes' field, 'Connector ID' field, 'Request offline access' checkbox, and 'Login' button](images/dex-test-app.png)
%>
<% end %>

1. A page appears listing the ID Token, Access Token, Refresh Token, ID Token Issuer (`iss` claim), and other information.

    ![Page lists: 'ID Token' with cert, 'Access Token' with token, 'Claims' with access structure for user 'alana', and 'Refresh Token' token string](images/dex-test-output.png)

1. Wait for the token to be generated.  
1. Edit your `.kube/config` file to add a new context for the test user:   

    ```
    apiVersion: v1
    clusters:
    - cluster:
        certificate-authority-data: CA-CERT
        server: CLUSTER-URL
      name: TEST-CLUSTER
    contexts:
    - [EXISTING-CONTEXTS]
    - context:
        cluster: TEST-CLUSTER
        user: TEST-USER
      name: TEST-CONTEXT
    current-context: TEST-CONTEXT
    kind: Config
    preferences: {}
    users:
    - [EXISTING-USERS]
    - name: TEST-USER
      user:
        token: ID-TOKEN
    ```
    Where:  

    * `CA` is your CA certificate.  
    * `CLUSTER-URL` is the address of the test service, such as `https://cluster.example.com:8443`.  
    * `TEST-CLUSTER` is the name of the test cluster, such as `cluster-with-custom-oidc`.  
    * `TEST-USER` is the test account username, such as `alana`.  
    * `TEST-CONTEXT` is a name you create for the new context, such as `cluster-with-custom-oidc-ldap-alana`.  
    * `ID-TOKEN` is the ID Token retrieved by the `example-app` app above.  

    Include the `cluster.server` and `user.token` values retrieved using the example app.  


1. Create a `ClusterRole` YAML file that grants permissions to access services and pods in the `default` namespace:

    ```
    apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
    kind: ClusterRole
    metadata:
      namespace: default
      name: pod-reader-clusterRolebinding
    rules:
    - apiGroups: [""] # "" indicates the core API group
      resources: ["pods", "services"]
      verbs: ["get", "watch", "list"]
    ```

1. Run `kubectl apply` or `kubectl create` to pass the `ClusterRole` spec file to the kube controller:

    ```
    kubectl apply -f ClusterRole.yml
    ```

1. Create a `ClusterRoleBinding` YAML file that applies the `ClusterRole` role to the test user.  
<br>
    For example:

    ```
    apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
    # This role binding allows "alana@test.com" to read pods in the "default" namespace.
    kind: ClusterRoleBinding
    metadata:
      name: read-pods-clusterRolebinding
      namespace: default
    subjects:
    - kind: User
      name: alana@test.com # Name is case sensitive
      apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
    roleRef:
      kind: ClusterRole #this must be Role or ClusterRole
      name: pod-reader-clusterRolebinding # this must match the name of the Role or ClusterRole you wish to bind to
      apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
    ```

1. Run `kubectl apply` or `kubectl create` to pass the `ClusterRoleBinding` spec file to the kube controller:

    ```
    kubectl apply -f ClusterRoleBinding.yml
    ```

1. Confirm the test user can run the following:  

    ```
    kubectl get pods
    ```

    The cluster is successfully authenticating the user by connecting to the dex OIDC provider via OIDC 
    if the test user can run `kubectl get pods`.

### <a id='example-dex-yaml'></a> Example dex YAML File

To create a dex YAML configuration file for connecting to an LDAP server:  

1. If you do not have a TLS Certificate, create a certificate, key, and secret:  

    1. Download the [gencert.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dexidp/dex/007e4dae3c7b0e05c31c67b5a4d61e0f943e0b68/examples/k8s/gencert.sh) script from GitHub.  
    1. If needed, reconfigure the script. For example the script provides `DNS.1 = dex.example.com` as an `alt_names` value.  
    2. Run the `gencert.sh` script.  
    3. Create a secret using the newly created certificate and key:  

        ```
        kubectl create secret tls SECRET-NAME --key ssl/key.pem --cert ssl/cert.pem
        ```

        Where `SECRET-NAME` is the secret name, for example `dex.example.com.tls`.  

1. Use the following example configurations to create your dex YAML file:  

    * [Deployment Configuration](#example-dex-yaml-deployment)  
    * [dex ConfigMap Configuration](#example-dex-yaml-configmap)  
    * [Service Account Configuration](#example-dex-yaml-service)  
    * [ClusterRole Configuration](#example-dex-yaml-clusterrole)  
    * [ClusterRoleBinding Configuration](#example-dex-yaml-clusterrolebinding)
