1. Log in to the BOSH Director. For instructions, see [Log in to the BOSH Director VM](diagnostic-tools.html#alias).

1. To identify your Kubernetes cluster deployment name, run the following command:
  <pre>bosh -e ENVIRONMENT deployments</pre>

    Where `ENVIRONMENT` is your BOSH environment alias.
  <br>
  <br>
    For example:
      <pre class="terminal">$ bosh -e tkgi deployments</pre>
      Kubernetes cluster deployment names begin with `service-instance` and include
      a BOSH-generated identifier.

1. To identify your Kubernetes cluster VM name, run the following command:
  <pre>bosh -e ENVIRONMENT -d DEPLOYMENT vms</pre>

    Where:  

     * `ENVIRONMENT` is the BOSH environment alias.  
     * `DEPLOYMENT` is your Kubernetes cluster deployment name.

    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">$ bosh -e tkgi -d service-instance_ae681cd1-7ff4-4661-b12c-49a5b543f16f vms</pre>
    Each Kubernetes cluster VM name begins with `master` or `worker` and includes a BOSH-generated identifier.

1. To SSH into your Kubernetes cluster VM, run the following command:
  <pre>bosh -e ENVIRONMENT -d DEPLOYMENT ssh CLUSTER-VM</pre>

    Where:  

    * `ENVIRONMENT` is the BOSH environment alias.  
    * `DEPLOYMENT` is your Kubernetes cluster deployment name.  
    * `CLUSTER-VM` is your Kubernetes cluster VM name, either `master/VM-ID` or `worker/VM-ID`.

    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">$ bosh -e tkgi -d service-instance_ae681cd1-7ff4-4661-b12c-49a5b543f16f ssh master/000a1111-222b-3333-4cc5-de66f7a8899b</pre>
