This topic describes how to use BOSH Backup and Restore (BBR) to back up the <%= vars.product_full %> Control Plane and its cluster deployments.

##<a id="overview"></a> Overview

The BOSH Director, <%= vars.product_short %> Control Plane, and cluster deployments include custom backup and restore scripts which encapsulate the correct procedure
for backing up and restoring the Director and Control Plane.

BBR orchestrates running the backup and restore scripts and transferring the generated backup artifacts to and from a backup directory.
If configured correctly, BBR can use TLS to communicate securely with backup targets.

* To perform a restore of the BOSH Director, see [Restore the BOSH Director](bbr-restore.html#redeploy-restore-director).
* To perform a restore of the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Control Plane, see [Restore the <%= vars.product_short %> Control Plane](bbr-restore.html#redeploy-restore-control-plane).
* To perform a restore of a cluster deployment, see [Restore <%= vars.product_short %> Clusters](bbr-restore.html#redeploy-restore-clusters).

To view the BBR release notes, see the Cloud Foundry documentation, [BOSH Backup and Restore Release Notes](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/bbr/bbr-rn.html).

## <a id='recs'></a> Recommendations

<%= vars.recommended_by %> recommends:

* Follow the full procedure documented in this topic when creating a backup. This ensures that you always have a consistent backup of Ops Manager and <%= vars.product_short %> to restore from.

* Back up frequently, especially before upgrading your <%= vars.product_short %> deployment.

* For BOSH v270.0 and above (currently in <%= vars.platform_name %> 2.7), prune the BOSH blobstore by running `bosh clean-up --all` prior to running a backup of the BOSH director. This removes all unused resources, including packages compiled against older stemcell versions, which can result in a smaller, faster backup of the BOSH Director. For more information see the [`clean-Up`](https://bosh.io/docs/cli-v2/#clean-up) command.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong>The command <code>bosh clean-up --all</code> is a destructive operation and can remove resources that are unused but needed. For example, if an On-Demand Service Broker such as <%= vars.product_short %> is deployed <strong>and</strong> no service instances have been created, the releases needed to create a service instance will be categorized as unused and removed.</p>

## <a id='supported'></a> Supported Components

## <a id='backup'></a> Back Up <%= vars.product_short %>

To back up your <%= vars.product_short %> environment you must first connect to your jumpbox before executing `bbr` backup commands.

### <a id='connect-to-jumpbox'></a> Connect to Your Jumpbox

You can establish a connection to your jumpbox in one of the following ways:

* [Connect with SSH](#ssh)
* [Connect with BOSH&#95;ALL&#95;PROXY](#bosh-all-proxy)

For general information about the jumpbox, see [Installing BOSH Backup and Restore](bbr-install.html).

#### <a id='ssh'></a> Connect with SSH

To connect to your jumpbox with SSH, do one of the following:

+ **If you are using the Ops Manager VM as your jumpbox, log in to the Ops Manager VM.** See
    [Log in to the Ops Manager VM with SSH](https://docs.pivotal.io/ops-manager/install/trouble-advanced.html#ssh) in _Advanced Troubleshooting with the BOSH CLI_.
    <br><br>
+ **If you want to connect to your jumpbox using the command line, run the following
 command:**

    ```
    ssh -i PATH-TO-KEY JUMPBOX-USERNAME@JUMPBOX-ADDRESS
    ```
    Where:  

    * `PATH-TO-KEY` is the local path to your private key for the jumpbox host.
    * `JUMPBOX-USERNAME` is your jumpbox username.
    * `JUMPBOX-ADDRESS` is the address of the jumpbox.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If you connect to your jumpbox with SSH, you must run the BBR commands
  in the following sections from within your jumpbox.</p>


#### <a id='bosh-all-proxy'></a> Connect with BOSH&#95;ALL&#95;PROXY

You can use the `BOSH_ALL_PROXY` environment variable to open an SSH tunnel with SOCKS5 to your jumpbox.
This tunnel enables you to forward requests from your local machine to the BOSH Director through the jumpbox.
When `BOSH_ALL_PROXY` is set, BBR always uses its value to forward requests to the BOSH Director.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong>
  For the following procedures to work, ensure the SOCKS port is not already in use by a different tunnel or process.</p>

To connect with `BOSH_ALL_PROXY`, do one of the following:

* **If you want to establish the tunnel separate from the BOSH CLI, do the following:**
    1. Establish the tunnel and make it available on a local port by running the following command:

        ```
        ssh -4 -D SOCKS-PORT -fNC JUMPBOX-USERNAME@JUMPBOX-ADDRESS -i JUMPBOX-KEY-FILE -o ServerAliveInterval=60
        ```

        Where:

      * `SOCKS-PORT` is the local SOCKS port.
      * `JUMPBOX-USERNAME` is your jumpbox username.
      * `JUMPBOX-ADDRESS` is the address of the jumpbox.
      * `JUMPBOX-KEY-FILE` is the local SSH private key for accessing the jumpbox.

        For example:
        <pre class="terminal">$ ssh -4 -D 12345 -fNC jumpbox<span>@</span>203.0.113.0 -i jumpbox.key -o ServerAliveInterval=60</pre>
    1. Provide the BOSH CLI with access to the tunnel through `BOSH_ALL_PROXY` by running the following command:

        ```
        export BOSH_ALL_PROXY=socks5://localhost:SOCKS-PORT
        ```
        Where is `SOCKS-PORT` is your local SOCKS port.

* **If you want to establish the tunnel using the BOSH CLI, do the following:**
    1. Provide the BOSH CLI with the necessary SSH credentials to create the
    tunnel by running the following command:

        ```
        export BOSH_ALL_PROXY=ssh+socks5://JUMPBOX-USERNAME@JUMPBOX-ADDRESS:SOCKS-PORT?private_key=JUMPBOX-KEY-FILE
        ```

        Where:  

        * `JUMPBOX-USERNAME` is your jumpbox username.
        * `JUMPBOX-ADDRESS` is the address of the jumpbox.
        * `SOCKS-PORT` is your local SOCKS port.
        * `JUMPBOX-KEY-FILE` is the local SSH private key for accessing the jumpbox.

        For example:
        <pre class="terminal">$ export BOSH\_ALL\_PROXY=ssh+socks5<span>:</span>//jumpbox<span>@</span>203.0.113.0:12345?private_key=jumpbox.key</pre>


<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Using <code>BOSH_ALL_PROXY</code> can result in longer
backup and restore times because of network performance degradation. All operations must pass
through the proxy which means moving backup artifacts can be significantly slower.</p>

<div class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> In BBR v1.5.0 and earlier,
  the tunnel created by the BOSH CLI does not include the <code>ServerAliveInterval</code> flag.
  This may result in your SSH connection timing out when transferring large artifacts.
  In BBR v1.5.1, the <code>ServerAliveInterval</code> flag is included.
  For more information,
  see  <a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/bosh-backup-and-restore/releases/tag/v1.5.1">bosh-backup-and-restore v1.5.1</a> on GitHub.
</div>

### <a id='export-opsman-settings'></a> Back Up Installation Settings

To ensure your BBR backup is reliable, your should also frequently export your Ops Manager installation settings as a backup.

There are two ways to export Ops Manager installation settings:

* [Export settings using the Ops Manager UI](#export-via-ui)
* [Export settings using the Ops Manager API](#export-via-api)

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you want to automate the back up process,
you can use the Ops Manager API to export your installation settings.</p>

When exporting your installation settings, keep in mind the following:

* You should always export your installation settings before following the steps in the
[Restore the BOSH Director](bbr-restore.html#redeploy-restore-director)
section of the *Restoring <%= vars.product_short %>* topic.

* You can only export Ops Manager installation settings after you have deployed at least once.

* Your Ops Manager settings export is only a backup of Ops Manager configuration settings.
The export is not a backup of your VMs or any external MySQL databases.

* Your Ops Manager settings export is encrypted. Make sure you keep track of your Decryption Passphrase
because this is needed to restore the Ops Manager settings.

#### <a id='export-via-ui'></a> Export Settings Using the Ops Manager UI

To export your Ops Manager installation settings using the Ops Manager UI, perform the following steps:

1. From the **Installation Dashboard** in the Ops Manager interface, click your username at the top right navigation.
1. Select **Settings**.
1. Select **Export Installation Settings**.
1. Click **Export Installation Settings**.

#### <a id='export-via-api'></a> Export Settings Using the Ops Manager API
To export your Ops Manager installation settings using the Ops Manager API, perform the following steps:

1. To export your installation settings using the Ops Manager API, run the following command:

    ```
    curl https://OPS-MAN-FQDN/api/v0/installation_asset_collection \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN" > installation.zip
    ```
    Where:  

    * `OPS-MAN-FQDN` is the fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) for your Ops Manager deployment.
    * `UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN` is your UAA access token. For more information, see Access the API.

### <a id='back-up-director'></a> Back Up the <%= vars.product_short %> BOSH Director

To back up BOSH Director you will validate your current configuration, then execute the `bbr` backup command.

#### <a id='back-up-director-validate'></a> Validate the <%= vars.product_short %> BOSH Director

1. To confirm that your BOSH Director is reachable and has the correct BBR scripts, run the following command:

    ```
    bbr director  --host BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP  --username bbr \
    --private-key-path PRIVATE-KEY-FILE  pre-backup-check
    ```
    Where:  

    * `BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP` is the address of the BOSH Director. If the BOSH Director is public, `BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP` is a URL, such as
    `https://my-bosh.xxx.cf-app.com`. Otherwise, this is the internal IP `BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP` which you can retrieve as show in
    [Retrieve the BOSH Director Address](#bosh-address).
    * `PRIVATE-KEY-FILE` is the path to the private key file that you can create from `Bbr Ssh Credentials` as shown in
    [Download the BBR SSH Credentials](#bbr-ssh-creds).

    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ bbr director --host 10.0.0.5 --username bbr \
    --private-key-path private-key.pem pre-backup-check
    </pre>

1. If the pre-backup check command fails, perform the following actions:
    1. Run the command again, adding the `--debug` flag to enable debug logs. For more information,
    see [BBR Logging](bbr-logging.html).
    1. Make any correction suggested in the output and run the pre-backup check again.

#### <a id='back-up-director-back-up'></a> Back Up the <%= vars.product_short %> BOSH Director
1. If the pre-backup check succeeds, run the BBR backup command from your jumpbox to back up the
<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> BOSH Director:

    ```
    bbr director --host BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP --username bbr \
    --private-key-path PRIVATE-KEY-FILE  backup
    ```

    Where:  

    * `BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP` is the address of the BOSH Director. If the BOSH Director is public, `BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP`
    is a URL, such as `https://my-bosh.xxx.cf-app.com`. Otherwise, this is the internal IP.
    See [Retrieve the BOSH Director Address](#bosh-address) for more information.
    * `PRIVATE-KEY-FILE` is the path to the private key file that you can create from `Bbr Ssh Credentials` as shown in
    [Download the BBR SSH Credentials](#bbr-ssh-creds).

    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ bbr director  --host 10.0.0.5 --username bbr \
    --private-key-path private-key.pem  backup
    </pre>

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The BBR backup command can take a long time to complete.
    You can run it independently of the SSH session so that the process can continue running even
    if your connection to the jumpbox fails. The command above uses <code>nohup</code>, but you can
    run the command in a <code>screen</code> or <code>tmux</code> session instead.</p>

1. If the command completes successfully, follow the steps in [Manage Your Backup Artifact](#good-practices) below.

1. If the backup command fails, perform the following actions:
    * Run the command again, adding the `--debug` flag to enable debug logs. For more information,
    see [BBR Logging](bbr-logging.html).
    * Follow the steps in [Recover from a Failing Command](#recover-from-failing-command).

### <a id='back-up-control-plane'></a> Back Up the <%= vars.product_short %> Control Plane

To back up your <%= vars.product_short %> Control Plane you will validate the Control Plane, then execute the `bbr` backup command.

#### <a id='locate-deploy-name'></a> Locate the <%= vars.product_short %> Deployment Name
Locate and record your <%= vars.product_short %> BOSH deployment name as follows:

1. Open an SSH connection to either your jumpbox, as described in the previous section, or the Ops Manager VM.
For instructions on how to SSH into the Ops Manager VM, see
[Log in to the Ops Manager VM with SSH](https://docs.pivotal.io/ops-manager/install/trouble-advanced.html#ssh)
in _Advanced Troubleshooting with the BOSH CLI_.
1. On the command line, run the following command to retrieve your <%= vars.product_short %> BOSH deployment name.

    ```
    BOSH-CLI-CREDENTIALS deployments | grep pivotal-container-service
    ```

    Where `BOSH-CLI-CREDENTIALS` is the full value that you copied from the BOSH Director tile in 
    [Download the BOSH Commandline Credentials](#bosh-cli-creds).
<br><br>
    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ BOSH_CLIENT=ops_manager BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET=p455w0rd BOSH_CA_CERT=/var/tempest/workspaces/default/root_ca_certificate BOSH_ENVIRONMENT=10.0.0.5 bosh deployments | grep pivotal-container-service

    pivotal-container-service-51f08f6402aaa960f041           backup-and-restore-sdk/1.9.0    bosh-google-kvm-ubuntu-jammy-go_agent/1.75  
    service-instance_4ffeb5b5-5182-4faa-9d92-696d97cc9ae1    bosh-dns/1.10.0                 bosh-google-kvm-ubuntu-jammy-go_agent/1.75  
    pivotal-container-service-51f08f6402aaa960f041  
    </pre>

1. Review the returned output. The <%= vars.product_short %> BOSH deployment name begins with
  `pivotal-container-service` and includes a unique identifier.
   In the example output above, the BOSH deployment name is `pivotal-container-service-51f08f6402aaa960f041`.

#### <a id='back-up-control-plane-check'></a> Validate the <%= vars.product_short %> Control Plane

1. To confirm that your <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> control plane is reachable and has a deployment that can be backed up, run the BBR pre-backup check command:

    ```
    BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET=BOSH-CLIENT-SECRET bbr deployment \
    --target BOSH-TARGET  --username BOSH-CLIENT --deployment DEPLOYMENT-NAME \
    --ca-cert PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERT \
    pre-backup-check
    ```
    Where:  

    * `BOSH-CLIENT-SECRET` is your BOSH client secret. If you do not know your BOSH Client Secret, open your BOSH Director tile,
    navigate to **Credentials > Bosh Commandline Credentials** and record the value for `BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET`.
    * `BOSH-TARGET` is your BOSH Environment setting. If you do not know your BOSH Environment setting, open your BOSH Director tile,
    navigate to **Credentials > Bosh Commandline Credentials** and record the value for `BOSH_ENVIRONMENT`. You must be able to
    reach the target address from the workstation where you run `bbr` commands.
    * `BOSH-CLIENT` is your BOSH Client Name. If you do not know your BOSH Client Name, open your BOSH Director tile,
    navigate to **Credentials > Bosh Commandline Credentials** and record the value for `BOSH_CLIENT`.
    * `DEPLOYMENT-NAME` is the <%= vars.product_short %> BOSH deployment name that you located in
    the [Locate the <%= vars.product_short %> Deployment Name](#locate-deploy-name) section above.
    * `PATH-TO-BOSH-CA-CERT` is the path to the root CA certificate that you downloaded in [Download the Root CA Certificate](#root-ca-cert) above.

    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET=p455w0rd bbr deployment \
    --target bosh.example.com --username admin --deployment cf-acceptance-0 \
    --ca-cert bosh.ca.cert \
    pre-backup-check
    </pre>

1. If the pre-backup check command fails, perform the following actions:
    1. Run the command again, adding the `--debug` flag to enable debug logs. For more information,
    see [BBR Logging](bbr-logging.html).
    1. Make any correction suggested in the output and run the pre-backup check again. For example,
    the deployment that you selected might not have the correct backup scripts, or the connection
    to the BOSH Director failed.

#### <a id='back-up-control-plane-backup'></a> Back Up the <%= vars.product_short %> Control Plane
If the pre-backup check succeeds, run the BBR backup command.

1. To back up the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> control plane, run the following BBR backup command from your jumpbox:

    ```
    BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET=BOSH-CLIENT-SECRET nohup bbr deployment \
    --target BOSH-TARGET --username BOSH-CLIENT --deployment DEPLOYMENT-NAME \
    --ca-cert PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERT \
    backup --with-manifest [--artifact-path]
    ```

    Where:  

    * `BOSH-CLIENT-SECRET` is your BOSH client secret. If you do not know your BOSH Client Secret, open your BOSH Director tile,
    navigate to **Credentials > Bosh Commandline Credentials** and record the value for `BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET`.
    * `BOSH-TARGET` is your BOSH Environment setting. If you do not know your BOSH Environment setting, open your BOSH Director tile,
    navigate to **Credentials > Bosh Commandline Credentials** and record the value for `BOSH_ENVIRONMENT`. You must be able to
    reach the target address from the workstation where you run <code>bbr</code> commands.
    * `BOSH-CLIENT` is your BOSH Client Name. If you do not know your BOSH Client Name, open your BOSH Director tile,
    navigate to **Credentials > Bosh Commandline Credentials** and record the value for `BOSH_CLIENT`.
    * `DEPLOYMENT-NAME` is the <%= vars.product_short %> BOSH deployment name that you located in
    the [Locate the <%= vars.product_short %> Deployment Name](#locate-deploy-name) section above.
    * `PATH-TO-BOSH-CA-CERT` is the path to the root CA certificate that you downloaded in [Download the Root CA Certificate](#root-ca-cert) above.
    * `--with-manifest` is necessary in order to redeploy your <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Control Plane in the case of its loss.
    `--with-manifest` is an optional `backup` parameter to include the manifest in the backup artifact.
    * `--artifact-path` is an optional `backup` parameter to specify the output path for the backup artifact.</td>

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The <code>--with-manifest</code> flag is necessary in order to redeploy your <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Control Plane in the case of its loss.
    The backup artifact created by this process contains credentials that you should keep secret.</p>

    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET=p455w0rd nohup bbr deployment \
    --target bosh.example.com  --username admin --deployment cf-acceptance-0 \
    --ca-cert bosh.ca.cert \
    backup --with-manifest
    </pre>

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The BBR backup command can take a long time to complete.
    You can run it independently of the SSH session so that the process can continue running even
    if your connection to the jumpbox fails. The command above uses <code>nohup</code>, but you can
    run the command in a <code>screen</code> or <code>tmux</code> session instead.</p>

1. If the command completes successfully, follow the steps in [Manage Your Backup Artifact](#good-practices) below.

1. If the backup command fails, perform the following actions:
    1. Run the command again, adding the `--debug` flag to enable debug logs. For more information,
    see [BBR Logging](bbr-logging.html).
    1. Follow the steps in [Recover from a Failing Command](#recover-from-failing-command).

### <a id='back-up-clusters'></a> Back Up Cluster Deployments

Before backing up your <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> cluster deployments you should verify that they can be backed up.

#### <a id='verify-deployments'></a> Verify Your Cluster Deployments
To verify that you can reach your <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> cluster deployments and that the deployments can be backed up, follow the steps below.

1. SSH into your jumpbox. For more information about the jumpbox, see
[Configure Your Jumpbox](bbr-install.html#jumpbox-setup) in _Installing BOSH Backup and Restore_.
1. To perform the BBR pre-backup check, run the following command from your jumpbox:

    ```
    BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET=TKGI-UAA-CLIENT-SECRET  bbr deployment \
    --all-deployments  --target BOSH-TARGET  --username TKGI-UAA-CLIENT-NAME \
    --ca-cert PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERT \
    pre-backup-check
    ```

    Where:  

    * `TKGI-UAA-CLIENT-SECRET` is the value you recorded for `uaa_client_secret` in
    [Download the UAA Client Credentials](#cluster-creds) above.
    * `BOSH-TARGET` is the value you recorded for the BOSH Director's address in
    [Retrieve the BOSH Director Address](#bosh-address) above.
    You must be able to reach the target address from the machine where you run `bbr` commands.
    * `TKGI-UAA-CLIENT-NAME` is the value you recorded for `uaa_client_name` in
    [Download the UAA Client Credentials](#cluster-creds) above.
    * `PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERT` is the path to the root CA certificate that you downloaded in
    [Download or Locate Root CA Certificate](#root-ca-cert) above.

    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ BOSH\_CLIENT\_SECRET=p455w0rd  bbr deployment \
    --all-deployments --target bosh.example.com --username pivotal-container-service-12345abcdefghijklmn \
    --ca-cert /var/tempest/workspaces/default/root\_ca\_certificate \
    pre-backup-check
    </pre>

1. If the pre-backup-check command is successful, the command returns a list of cluster
deployments that can be backed up.

     <br>

     For example:
     <pre class="terminal">
     [21:51:23] Pending: service-instance\_abcdeg-1234-5678-hijk-90101112131415
     [21:51:23] -------------------------
     [21:51:31] Deployment 'service-instance\_abcdeg-1234-5678-hijk-90101112131415' can be backed up.
     [21:51:31] -------------------------
     [21:51:31] Successfully can be backed up: service-instance\_abcdeg-1234-5678-hijk-90101112131415
     </pre>

     In the output above, `service-instance_abcdeg-1234-5678-hijk-90101112131415` is the
     BOSH deployment name of a <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> cluster.

1. If the pre-backup-check command fails, do one or more of the following:
    * Make sure you are using the correct <%= vars.product_tile %> credentials.
    * Run the command again, adding the `--debug` flag to enable debug logs. For more information,
    see [BBR Logging](bbr-logging.html).
    * Make the changes suggested in the output and run the pre-backup check again. For example,
    the deployments might not have the correct backup scripts, or the connection to
    the BOSH Director failed.

#### <a id='back-up-clusters-back-up'></a> Back Up Cluster Deployments

When backing up your <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> cluster, you can choose to back up only one cluster or to backup all cluster deployments in scope.
The procedures to do this are the following:

* [Back up All Cluster Deployments](#back-up-all)
* [Back Up One Cluster Deployment](#back-up-one)

##### <a id='back-up-all'></a> Back Up All Cluster Deployments

The following procedure backs up all cluster deployments.

Make sure you use the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> UAA credentials that you recorded in
[Download the UAA Client Credentials](#cluster-creds).
These credentials limit the scope of the backup to cluster deployments only.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The BBR backup command can take a long time to complete.
You can run it independently of the SSH session so that the process can continue running even if
your connection to the jumpbox fails.
The command above uses <code>nohup</code>, but you could also run the command in a
<code>screen</code> or <code>tmux</code> session.</p>

1. To back up all cluster deployments, run the following command from your jumpbox:

    ```
    BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET=TKGI-UAA-CLIENT-SECRET nohup bbr deployment \
    --all-deployments --target BOSH-TARGET --username TKGI-UAA-CLIENT-NAME \
    --ca-cert PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERT \
    backup [--with-manifest] [--artifact-path]
    ```

    Where:  

    * `TKGI-UAA-CLIENT-SECRET` is the value you recorded for `uaa_client_secret` in
    [Download the UAA Client Credentials](#cluster-creds) above.
    * `BOSH-TARGET` is the value you recorded for the BOSH Director's address in
    [Retrieve the BOSH Director Address](#bosh-address) above.
    You must be able to reach the target address from the machine where you run `bbr` commands.
    * `TKGI-UAA-CLIENT-NAME` is the value you recorded for `uaa_client_name` in
    [Download the UAA Client Credentials](#cluster-creds) above.
    * `PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERT` is the path to the root CA certificate that you downloaded in

    * `--with-manifest` is an optional `backup` parameter to include the manifest in the backup artifact.
    If you use this flag, the backup artifact then contains credentials that you should keep secret.
    * `--artifact-path` is an optional `backup` parameter to specify the output path for the backup artifact.

    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">

    nohup bbr deployment \
    --all-deployments \
    --target bosh.example.com \
    --username pivotal-container-service-12345abcdefghijklmn \
    --ca-cert /var/tempest/workspaces/default/root\_ca\_certificate \
    backup
    </pre>

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The optional <code>--with-manifest</code> flag directs BBR to create a backup
    containing credentials. You should manage the generated backup artifact knowing it contains secrets for administering
    your environment.</p>

1. If the `backup` command completes successfully, follow the steps in [Manage Your Backup Artifact](#good-practices) below.

1. If the backup command fails, the backup operation exits. BBR does not attempt to continue backing up any
non-backed up clusters. To troubleshoot a failing backup, do one or more of the following:
    * Run the command again, adding the `--debug` flag to enable debug logs. For more information,
    see [BBR Logging](bbr-logging.html).
    * Follow the steps in [Recover from a Failing Command](#recover-from-failing-command) below.

##### <a id='back-up-one'></a> Back Up One Cluster Deployment

1. To backup a single, specific cluster deployment, run the following command from your jumpbox:

    ```
    BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET=TKGI-UAA-CLIENT-SECRET \
    nohup bbr deployment \
    --deployment CLUSTER-DEPLOYMENT-NAME \
    --target BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP \
    --username TKGI-UAA-CLIENT-NAME \
    --ca-cert PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERT \
    backup [--with-manifest] [--artifact-path]
    ```

    Where:  

    * `TKGI-UAA-CLIENT-SECRET` is the value you recorded for `uaa_client_secret` in
    [Download the UAA Client Credentials](#cluster-creds) above.
    * `CLUSTER-DEPLOYMENT-NAME` is the value you recorded in
    [Retrieve your Cluster Deployment Name](#cluster-deployment-name) above.
    * `BOSH-TARGET` is the value you recorded for the BOSH Director's address in
    [Retrieve the BOSH Director Address](#bosh-address) above. You must be able to reach the
    target address from the machine where you run `bbr` commands.
    * `TKGI-UAA-CLIENT-NAME` is the value you recorded for `uaa_client_name` in
    [Download the UAA Client Credentials](#cluster-creds) above.
    * `PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERT` is the path to the root CA certificate that you downloaded in
    [Download the Root CA Certificate](#root-ca-cert) above.
    * `--with-manifest` is an optional `backup` parameter to include the manifest in the backup artifact.
    If you use this flag, the backup artifact then contains credentials that you should keep secret.
    * `--artifact-path` is an optional `backup` parameter to specify the output path for the backup artifact.

    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ BOSH\_CLIENT\_SECRET=p455w0rd  nohup bbr deployment \
    --deployment service-instance\_abcdeg-1234-5678-hijk-9010111213141 \
    --target bosh.example.com  --username pivotal-container-service-12345abcdefghijklmn \
    --ca-cert /var/tempest/workspaces/default/root\_ca\_certificate \
    backup
    </pre>

### <a id='cancel-backup'></a> Cancel a Backup

Backups can take a long time. If you realize that the backup is going to fail or that
your developers need to push an app immediately, you might need to cancel the backup.

To cancel a backup, perform the following steps:

1. Terminate the BBR process by pressing Ctrl-C and typing `yes` to confirm.
1. Because stopping a backup can leave the system in an unusable state and prevent additional
backups, follow the procedures in [Clean up After a Failed Backup](#manual-clean) below.

## <a id="backup-vsphere"></a> Back Up vCenter, and NSX if Used (vSphere Only)

If you are running <%= vars.product_short %> on vSphere with or without NSX-T
networking, you must back up your vCenter in addition to completing the BBR
procedures above.

For <%= vars.product_short %> deployments with NSX-T networking, you must also
back up the NSX Manager.

To complete the backup of your <%= vars.product_short %> environment running
on vSphere:

1. Back up vCenter. See
[Overview of Backup and Restore options in vCenter Server 6.x (2149237)](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/2149237)
in the VMware documentation.
1. If you use NSX-T networking, back up the NSX Manager. See
[Backing Up and Restoring the NSX Manager](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T/2.1/com.vmware.nsxt.admin.doc/GUID-A0B3667C-FB7D-413F-816D-019BFAD81AC5.html)
in the VMware documentation.

## <a id="after-backup"></a> After Backing Up <%= vars.product_short %>

After the backup has completed you should review and manage the generated backup artifacts.

### <a id="good-practices"></a> Manage Your Backup Artifact
The BBR-created backup consists of a directory containing the backup artifacts and metadata files.
BBR stores each completed backup directory within the current working directory.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The optional <code>--with-manifest</code> flag directs BBR to create a backup
containing credentials. You should manage the generated backup artifact knowing it contains secrets for administering
your environment.</p>

BBR backup artifact directories are named using the following formats:

* `DIRECTOR-IP-TIMESTAMP` for the BOSH Director backups.
* `DEPLOYMENT-TIMESTAMP` for the Control Plane backup.
* `DEPLOYMENT-TIMESTAMP` for the cluster deployment backups.

Keep your backup artifacts safe by following these steps:

1. Move the backup artifacts off the jumpbox to your storage space.

1. Compress and encrypt the backup artifacts when storing them.

1. Make redundant copies of your backup and store them in multiple locations. This minimizes the
risk of losing your backups in the event of a disaster.

1. Each time you redeploy <%= vars.product_short %>, test your backup artifact by following the procedures in:
    * [Restore the <%= vars.product_short %> BOSH Director](bbr-restore.html#redeploy-restore-director)
    * [Restore the <%= vars.product_short %> Control Plane](bbr-restore.html#redeploy-restore-control-plane)
    * [Restore <%= vars.product_short %> Clusters](bbr-restore.html#redeploy-restore-clusters)

### <a id="recover-from-failing-command"></a> Recover from a Failing Command

If the backup fails, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that you set all the parameters in the backup command.
1. Ensure the credentials previously obtained are valid.
1. Ensure the deployment that you specify in the BBR command exists.
1. Ensure that the jumpbox can reach the BOSH Director.
1. Consult [BBR Logging](bbr-logging.html).
1. If you see the error message: `Directory /var/vcap/store/bbr-backup already exists on instance`,
   run the appropriate cleanup command. See [Clean Up After a Failed Backup](#manual-clean) below for more information.
1. If the backup artifact is corrupted, discard the failing artifacts and run the backup again.


### <a id="manual-clean"></a> Clean Up after a Failed Backup

If your backup process fails, use the BBR cleanup script to clean up the failed run.

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning</strong>: It is important to run the BBR cleanup script after a
failed BBR backup run. A failed backup run might leave the BBR backup directory on the instance,
causing any subsequent attempts to backup to fail. In addition, BBR might not have run the post-backup scripts,
leaving the instance in a locked state.</p>

* If the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> BOSH Director backup failed, run the following BBR cleanup script command to clean up:

    ```
    bbr director --host BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP \
    --username bbr  --private-key-path PRIVATE-KEY-FILE \
    backup-cleanup
    ```

    Where:  

    * `BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP` is the address of the BOSH Director. If the BOSH Director is public,
    `BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP` is a URL, such as `https://my-bosh.xxx.cf-app.com`. Otherwise, this is the internal
    IP `BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP` which you can retrieve as show in [Retrieve the BOSH Director Address](#bosh-address) above.
    * `PRIVATE-KEY-FILE` is the path to the private key file that you can create from `Bbr Ssh Credentials` as shown in
    [Download the BBR SSH Credentials](#bbr-ssh-creds) above. Replace the placeholder text using the
    information in the following table.

    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ bbr director  --host 10.0.0.5  --username bbr \
    --private-key-path private-key.pem \
    backup-cleanup
    </pre>

* If the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> control plane or <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> clusters backups fail, run the following BBR cleanup script command to clean up:

    ```
    BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET=BOSH-CLIENT-SECRET \
    bbr deployment \
    --target BOSH-TARGET \
    --username BOSH-CLIENT \
    --deployment DEPLOYMENT-NAME \
    --ca-cert PATH-TO-BOSH-CA-CERT \
    backup-cleanup
    ```

    Where:  

    * `BOSH-CLIENT-SECRET` is your BOSH client secret. If you do not know your BOSH Client Secret,
    open your BOSH Director tile, navigate to **Credentials > Bosh Commandline Credentials** and
    record the value for `BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET`.
    * `BOSH-TARGET` is your BOSH Environment setting. If you do not know your BOSH Environment setting,
    open your BOSH Director tile,     navigate to **Credentials > Bosh Commandline Credentials** and
    record the value for `BOSH_ENVIRONMENT`. You must be able to reach the target address from the
    workstation where you run `bbr` commands.
    * `BOSH-CLIENT` is your BOSH Client Name. If you do not know your BOSH Client Name, open your BOSH Director tile,
    navigate to **Credentials > Bosh Commandline Credentials** and record the value for `BOSH_CLIENT`.
    * `DEPLOYMENT-NAME` is the <%= vars.product_short %> BOSH deployment name that you located in
    the [Locate the <%= vars.product_short %> Deployment Names](#locate-deploy-name) section above.
    * `PATH-TO-BOSH-CA-CERT` is the path to the root CA certificate that you downloaded in
    [Download the Root CA Certificate](#root-ca-cert) above.

    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ BOSH&#95;CLIENT&#95;SECRET=p455w0rd bbr deployment \
    --target bosh.example.com --username admin --deployment cf-acceptance-0 \
    --ca-cert bosh.ca.crt \
    backup-cleanup
    </pre>

If the cleanup script fails, consult the following table to match the exit codes to an error
message.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Value</th>
    <th>Error</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>Success</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>General failure</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>8</td>
    <td>The post-backup unlock failed. One of your deployments might be in a bad state and require
      attention.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>16</td>
    <td>The cleanup failed. This is a non-fatal error indicating that the utility has been unable
      to clean up open BOSH SSH connections to a deployment's VMs. Manual cleanup might be required
      to clear any hanging BOSH users and connections.</td>
  </tr>
