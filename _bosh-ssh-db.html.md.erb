1. Log in to the BOSH Director. For instructions, see [Log in to the BOSH Director VM](diagnostic-tools.html#alias).

1. To identify your <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> deployment name:  

    ```
    bosh -e ENVIRONMENT deployments
    ```

    Where `ENVIRONMENT` is your BOSH environment alias.  
<br>
    For example:  
    ```console
    $ bosh -e tkgi deployments
    ```
    Your <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> deployment name begins with `pivotal-container-service` and includes
    a BOSH-generated identifier.  

1. To identify your <%= vars.control_plane_db %> VM names:  

    ```
    bosh -e ENVIRONMENT -d DEPLOYMENT vms
    ```

    Where:  

     * `ENVIRONMENT` is the BOSH environment alias.  
     * `DEPLOYMENT` is your <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> deployment name.  

    For example:  
    ```console
    $ bosh -e tkgi -d pivotal-container-service-a1b2c333d444e5f66a77 vms
    ```

    Your <%= vars.control_plane_db %> VM names begin with `pks-db` and include a
    BOSH-generated identifier.  

1. Choose one of the returned <%= vars.control_plane_db %> VMs as the database VM to SSH into.  
1. To SSH into the selected <%= vars.control_plane_db %> VM, run the following command:  

    ```
    bosh -e ENVIRONMENT -d DEPLOYMENT ssh TKGI-DB-VM
    ```

    Where:  

    * `ENVIRONMENT` is the BOSH environment alias.  
    * `DEPLOYMENT` is your <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> deployment name.  
    * `TKGI-DB-VM` is the name of the <%= vars.control_plane_db %> VM to SSH into.  

    For example:  
    ```console
    $ bosh -e tkgi \
    -d pivotal-container-service-a1b2c333d444e5f66a77 \
    ssh pks-db/000a4444-555b-6666-4cc5-de66f8a9900b
    ```
