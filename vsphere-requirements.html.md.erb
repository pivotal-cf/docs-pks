This topic describes the prerequisites and resource requirements for installing Pivotal Container
Service (PKS) on vSphere.

For prerequisites and resource requirements for installing PKS on vSphere with NSX-T integration,
see [vSphere with NSX-T Version Requirements](vsphere-nsxt-requirements.html) and 
[Hardware Requirements for PKS on vSphere with NSX-T](./vsphere-nsxt-rpd-mpd.html).

PKS supports air-gapped deployments on vSphere with or without NSX-T integration.

You can also configure integration with the Harbor tile, an enterprise-class registry server for
container images. For more information, see
[VMware Harbor Registry](https://docs.pivotal.io/partners/vmware-harbor/index.html) in the
_Pivotal Partner documentation_.

##<a id='prerequisites'></a> Prerequisites

Before installing PKS, you must install Ops Manager.
You use Ops Manager to install and configure PKS.

To prepare your vSphere environment for installing Ops Manager and PKS, review
the sections below and then
follow the instructions in [Preparing vSphere Before Deploying PKS](vsphere-prepare-env.html).

##<a id='vsphere'></a> vSphere Version Requirements

PKS on vSphere supports the following vSphere component versions:

##<a id='resources'></a> Resource Requirements

Installing Ops Manager and PKS requires the following virtual machines (VMs):

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>VM</th>
    <th>CPU</th>
    <th>RAM</th>
    <th>Storage</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Pivotal Container Service</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>8 GB</td>
    <td>16 GB ^&#x2A;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Pivotal Ops Manager</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>8 GB</td>
    <td>160 GB</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>BOSH Director</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>8 GB</td>
    <td>16 GB</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h3> Ephemeral VM Resources </h3>

Each PKS deployment requires ephemeral VMs during installation and upgrades of PKS.
After you deploy PKS, BOSH automatically deletes these VMs.

To enable PKS to dynamically create the ephemeral VMs when needed, ensure that the following
resources are available in your vSphere infrastructure before deploying PKS:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Ephemeral VM</th>
    <th>Number</th>
    <th>CPU Cores</th>
    <th>RAM</th>
    <th>Ephemeral Disk</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>BOSH Compilation VMs</td>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>4 GB</td>
    <td>32 GB</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h3> Kubernetes Cluster Resources </h3>

Each Kubernetes cluster provisioned through PKS deploys the VMs listed below. If you deploy more
than one Kubernetes cluster, you must scale your allocated resources appropriately.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>VM</th>
    <th>Number</th>
    <th>CPU Cores</th>
    <th>RAM</th>
    <th>Ephemeral Disk</th>
    <th>Persistent Disk</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>master</td>
    <td>1 or 3</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>4 GB</td>
    <td>8 GB</td>
    <td>5 GB</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>worker</td>
    <td>1 or more</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>4 GB</td>
    <td>8 GB</td>
    <td>50 GB</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>errand (ephemeral)</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>1 GB</td>
    <td>8 GB</td>
    <td>none</td>
  </tr>
</table>
