This topic explains how to upgrade the Pivotal Container Service (PKS) tile and existing Kubernetes clusters.

The supported upgrade paths to PKS v1.3.x are from PKS v1.2.5 and later. PKS v1.3.x is compatible with Ops Manager v2.3.1 or later and Ops Manager v2.4.x.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Ops Manager v2.3.10 and later
and Ops Manager v2.4.4 and later do not support PKS v1.3.x on Azure.
Before deploying PKS v1.3.x on Azure, you must install Ops Manager v2.3.9 or
earlier or Ops Manager v2.4.3 or earlier.</p>

For conceptual information about upgrading the PKS tile and PKS-provisioned Kubernetes clusters,
see [What Happens During PKS Upgrades](understanding-upgrades.html).

For information about upgrading PKS on vSphere with NSX-T integration, see
[Upgrading PKS with NSX-T](upgrade-pks-nsxt.html).

<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING</strong>: Do not manually upgrade your Kubernetes version. The PKS service includes the compatible Kubernetes version.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Upgrading from PKS v1.2.5+ to PKS v1.3.x causes all certificates to be automatically regenerated. The old certificate authority is still trusted, and has a validity of one year. But the new certificates are signed with a new certificate authority, which is valid for four years.</p>

## <a id="before"></a>Before You Upgrade

This section describes the activities you must perform before upgrading PKS.

### <a id="prepare"></a>Prepare to Upgrade

If you have not already, complete the steps in the [Upgrade Preparation Checklist for PKS v1.3](checklist.html).

## <a id="upgrade"></a> During the Upgrade

This section describes the steps required to upgrade to PKS v1.3.x.

### <a id="upgrade-pks"></a> Step 1: Upgrade to PKS v1.2.5 or Later

Skip this step if you are already running PKS v1.2.5+.

Follow the procedures detailed in [Upgrading PKS](https://docs.pivotal.io/pks/1-2/upgrade-pks.html) in the PKS v1.2 documentation.

### <a id="upgrade-opsman"></a> Step 2: Upgrade to Ops Manager v2.3.1+ or v2.4.x

Before you upgrade to PKS v1.3.x, you must upgrade to Ops Manager v2.3.1+ or v2.4.x.

1. Follow the procedures detailed in [Upgrade Ops Manager and Installed Products to v2.3](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-3/customizing/upgrading-pcf.html#upgrade_ops) or [Upgrade Ops Manager and Installed Products to v2.4](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-4/customizing/upgrading-pcf.html#upgrade_ops).

1. <%= partial 'add-clusters-workloads' %>

### <a id="upgrade-tile"></a> Step 3: Upgrade to PKS v1.3.x

To upgrade to PKS v1.3.x, follow the same Ops Manager process that you use to install
the tile for the first time.

Your configuration settings migrate to the new version automatically. Follow the steps below to perform an upgrade.

1. Review the [Release Notes](release-notes.html) for the version you are upgrading to.

1. Download the desired version of the product from [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-container-service/).

1. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Import a Product** to upload the product file.

1. Under the **Import a Product** button, click **+** next to **Pivotal Container Service**. This adds the tile to your staging area.

### <a id="stemcell"></a> Step 4: Download and Import the Stemcell

PKS v1.3.x uses a [Xenial stemcell](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-4/stemcells/#xenial).

If Ops Manager does not have the Xenial stemcell required for PKS, the PKS tile displays the message **Missing stemcell**.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If the <b>Stemcell Library</b> in Ops Manager already has a compatible Xenial stemcell,
  the <b>Missing stemcell</b> link does not appear. You do not need to download or import a new stemcell and can skip this step.</p>

To download and import a new Xenial stemcell, follow the steps below:

1. On the **Pivotal Container Service** tile, click on the **Missing stemcell** link.

    <img src="images/missing_stemcell.png" alt="Verify stemcell assignment">

1. In the **Stemcell Library**, locate Pivotal Container Service and note the required stemcell version.

1. Visit the [Stemcells for PCF (Ubuntu Xenial)](https://network.pivotal.io/products/stemcells-ubuntu-xenial/) page on Pivotal Network,
and download the required stemcell version appropriate for your IaaS.

1. Return to the **Installation Dashboard** in Ops Manager, and click on **Stemcell Library**.

1. On the **Stemcell Library** page, click **Import Stemcell** and select the stemcell file you downloaded from Pivotal Network.

1. Select Pivotal Container Service and click **Apply Stemcell to Products**.

1. Verify that Ops Manager successfully applied the stemcell. The stemcell version you imported and applied appears in the **Staged** column for Pivotal Container Service.

1. Select the **Installation Dashboard** link to return to the Installation Dashboard.

### <a id="worker-nodes"></a> Step 5: Verify Errand Configuration

To verify that errands are configured correctly in the PKS tile, perform the following steps.

1. Click the newly-added **Pivotal Container Service** tile.

1. Click **Errands**.

1. Under **Post-Deploy Errands**, verify that the **Upgrade all clusters errand** is set to **Default (On)**. The errand upgrades a single Kubernetes cluster at a time. Upgrading PKS Kubernetes clusters can temporarily interrupt the service, as described in [Service Interruptions](interruptions.html).

    <p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING</strong>: If you are upgrading PKS, you must enable the <strong>Upgrade All Clusters</strong> errand.</p>

1. Under **Post-Deploy Errands**, set the **Run smoke tests** errand to **On**. The errand uses the PKS Command Line Interface (PKS CLI) to create a Kubernetes cluster and then delete it. If the creation or deletion fails, the errand fails and the installation of the PKS tile is aborted.

1. Review the other configuration panes. Click **Save** on any panes where you make changes.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: When you upgrade PKS, you must place singleton jobs in the AZ you selected when you first installed the PKS tile. You cannot move singleton jobs to another AZ.</p>

### <a id="apply-changes"></a> Step 6: Apply Changes to the PKS Tile

Perform the following steps to complete the upgrade to the PKS tile.

1. Return to the **Installation Dashboard** in Ops Manager.

1. Click **Review Pending Changes**. 
     For more information about this Ops Manager page, see
    [Reviewing Pending Product Changes](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-3/customizing/review-pending-changes.html).

1. Click **Apply Changes**.

1. (Optional) To monitor the progress of the **Upgrade all clusters errand** using the BOSH CLI, do the following:
      1. Log in to the BOSH Director by running `bosh -e MY-ENVIRONMENT log-in` from a VM that can access your PKS deployment. For more information, see [Managing PKS Deployments with BOSH](manage-deployments-bosh.html).
      1. Run `bosh -e MY-ENVIRONMENT tasks`.
      1. Locate the task number for the errand in the <strong>&#35;</strong> column of the BOSH output.
      1. Run `bosh task TASK-NUMBER`, replacing `TASK-NUMBER` with the task number you located in the previous step.

## <a id="after-upgrade"></a>After the Upgrade

After you complete the upgrade to PKS v1.3.x, complete the following verifications and upgrades.

### <a id="update-clis""></a> Update PKS and Kubernetes CLIs

Update the PKS and Kubernetes CLIs on any local machine 
where you run commands that interact with your upgraded version of PKS.

To update your CLIs, download and re-install the PKS and Kubernetes CLI distributions 
that are provided with PKS on Pivotal Network.

For more information about installing the CLIs, see the following topics:

* [Installing the PKS CLI](installing-pks-cli.html)

* [Installing the Kubernetes CLI](installing-kubectl-cli.html)

### <a id="verify-upgrade"></a> Verify the Upgrade

After you apply changes to the PKS tile and the upgrade is complete, perform the following steps:

1. Verify that your Kubernetes environment is healthy. To verify the health of your Kubernetes environment, see [Verifying
Deployment Health](verify-health.html#k8s).

### <a id="upgrade-vcenter"></a> (Optional) Upgrade vSphere

If you are deploying PKS on vSphere, consult the chart below, and upgrade vSphere if necessary.
