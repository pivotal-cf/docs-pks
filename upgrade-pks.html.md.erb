This topic explains how to upgrade <%= vars.product_full %> from v1.5 to v1.6 on vSphere without NSX-T integration,
Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Azure.

For instructions on upgrading <%= vars.product_short %> on vSphere with NSX-T integration, see
[Upgrading <%= vars.product_short %> with NSX-T](upgrade-pks-nsxt.html).

If you used VMware <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console to deploy <%= vars.product_short %> on vSphere, you must use the management console to perform upgrades. Refer to [Upgrade Enterprise PKS Management Console](./console/console-index.html) for details.

## <a id="overview"></a>Overview

The supported upgrade paths to <%= vars.product_short %> v1.6 are from <%= vars.product_short %> v1.5.x.
<%= vars.product_short %> v1.6 is compatible with Ops Manager <%= vars.ops_man_version_2_6 %> and Ops Manager <%= vars.ops_man_version_2_7 %>.

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> Do not manually upgrade your Kubernetes version. <%= vars.product_short %> includes the compatible Kubernetes version.</p>

Before you begin the upgrade, follow the procedures in the [Prerequisites](#before) section to plan and prepare your upgrade.

After you complete the prerequisite steps, continue to the procedures in the [During the Upgrade](#upgrade) section. These steps guide you through the process of upgrading Ops Manager, upgrading the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile, importing an updated stemcell, and applying the changes to your deployment.

After you complete the upgrade, follow the procedures in the [After the Upgrade](#after-upgrade) section to verify that your upgraded <%= vars.product_short %> deployment is running properly.

## <a id="before"></a>Prerequisites

Before you upgrade <%= vars.product_short %>, you must do the following:

1. [Determine Your Upgrade Path](#upgrade-path)
1. [Prepare to Upgrade](#prepare)

### <a id="upgrade-path"></a> Determine Your Upgrade Path

[Upgrade Preparation Checklist for <%= vars.product_short %> v1.6](./checklist.html).

## <a id="upgrade"></a> During the Upgrade

This section describes the steps required to upgrade to <%= vars.product_short %> v1.6:

1. [Upgrade to Ops Manager <%= vars.ops_man_version_2_7_short %> or <%= vars.ops_man_version_2_6_short %>](#upgrade-opsman)
1. [Upgrade to <%= vars.product_short %> v1.6](#upgrade-tile)
1. [Download and Import the Stemcell](#stemcell)
1. [Verify Errand Configuration](#errands)
1. [Apply Changes to the <%= vars.product_tile %> Tile](#apply-changes)

### <a id="upgrade-opsman"></a> Upgrade Ops Manager to <%= vars.ops_man_version_2_6_short %> or <%= vars.ops_man_version_2_7_short %>

Before you upgrade to <%= vars.product_short %> v1.6, you must upgrade to Ops Manager <%= vars.ops_man_version_2_6 %> or <%= vars.ops_man_version_2_7 %>.

To upgrade Ops Manager, do the following:

1. Complete the procedures in [Import Installation to Ops Manager v2.6 VM](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-6/customizing/upgrading-pcf.html#upgrade)
or [Import Installation to Ops Manager v2.7 VM](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/2-7/customizing/upgrading-pcf.html#upgrade).

1. <%= partial 'add-clusters-workloads' %>

### <a id="upgrade-tile"></a> Upgrade <%= vars.product_short %> to v1.6

When you upgrade <%= vars.product_short %>, your configuration settings typically migrate to the new version automatically. To perform an upgrade:

1. Review the [Release Notes](release-notes.html) for the version you are upgrading to.

1. Download the desired version of the product from [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-container-service/).

1. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Import a Product** to upload the product file.

1. Under the **Import a Product** button, click **+** next to **<%= vars.product_tile %>**. 
This adds the tile to your staging area.

### <a id="stemcell"></a> Download and Import the Stemcell

<%= vars.product_short %> requires a 
[Xenial stemcell](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-7/stemcells/#xenial). 
A stemcell for Windows 2019 is also required if you intend to create Windows worker-based clusters. 
For information about Windows stemcells, see 
[Configuring Windows Worker-Based Clusters (Beta)](windows-pks-beta.html).  

If Ops Manager does not have the Xenial stemcell required for <%= vars.product_short %>, 
the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile displays the message **Missing stemcell**.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If the <strong>Stemcell Library</strong> in Ops Manager already has a compatible Xenial stemcell, the <strong>Missing stemcell</strong> link does not appear. You do not need to download or import a new stemcell and can skip this step.</p>

To download and import a new Xenial stemcell, follow the steps below:

1. On the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile, click the **Missing stemcell** link.

    <img src="images/missing_stemcell.png" alt="Verify stemcell assignment">

1. In the **Stemcell Library**, locate the **<%= vars.product_tile %>** tile and note the required stemcell version.

1. Navigate to the [Pivotal Stemcells (Ubuntu Xenial)](https://network.pivotal.io/products/stemcells-ubuntu-xenial/) page on Pivotal Network
and download the required stemcell version for your IaaS.

1. Return to the **Installation Dashboard** in Ops Manager and click **Stemcell Library**.

1. On the **Stemcell Library** page, click **Import Stemcell** and select the stemcell file you downloaded from Pivotal Network.

1. Select the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile and click **Apply Stemcell to Products**.

1. Verify that Ops Manager successfully applied the stemcell. The stemcell version you imported and applied appears in the **Staged** column for <%= vars.product_tile %>.

1. Select the **Installation Dashboard** link to return to the Installation Dashboard.

### <a id="host-monitoring"></a> (Optional) Configure Host Monitoring

In <%= vars.product_short %> v1.6, the **Logging** screen is renamed 
to **Host Monitoring** and adds options to configure the Telegraf agent to collect metrics from Node Exporter, etcd, and the Kubelet agent and send the metrics to a third-party monitoring service.

### <a id="telemetry"></a> Verify CEIP and Telemetry Configuration

The VMware Customer Experience Improvement Program (CEIP)
and the Pivotal Telemetry Program (Telemetry) are enabled in <%= vars.product_short %> v1.6 by default.

If you do not want to participate in CEIP and Telemetry,
you must set your participation level to **None** in the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile.
To set your participation level to **None**:

1. Click the newly-added <%= vars.product_tile %> tile.
1. Click **CEIP and Telemetry**.
1. Under **Please select your participation level in the CEIP and Telemetry program**, set your participation level to **None**.

  * [Installing Enterprise PKS on GCP](./installing-pks-gcp.html#telemetry)

### <a id="errands"></a>Verify Errand Configuration

To verify that errands are configured correctly in the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile, do the following:

1. In the **<%= vars.product_tile %>** tile, click **Errands**.

1. Under **Post-Deploy Errands**, configure **Upgrade all clusters errand**:
  * If you want to upgrade the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile and all your existing Kubernetes clusters simultaneously,
  verify that **Upgrade all clusters errand** is set to **Default (On)**.
  The errand upgrades all clusters, one Kubernetes cluster at a time.
  Upgrading <%= vars.product_short %>-deployed Kubernetes clusters can temporarily interrupt the service
  as described in [Service Interruptions](interruptions.html).
  * If you want to upgrade the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile only and
  then upgrade your existing Kubernetes clusters separately, disable **Upgrade all clusters errand**.
  For more information, see [Upgrading Clusters](upgrade-clusters.html).
  <p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> If you upgrade the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile
  or update your tile configuration, with <strong>Upgrade all clusters errand</strong> disabled,
  you must upgrade all your Kubernetes clusters before the next upgrade or configuration update.</p>

1. Under **Post-Deploy Errands**, set the **Run smoke tests** errand to **On**. The errand uses the <%= vars.product_short %> Command Line Interface (PKS CLI) to create a Kubernetes cluster and then delete it. If the creation or deletion fails, the errand fails and the installation of the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile is aborted.

1. Click **Save**.

1. Review the other configuration panes. Click **Save** on any panes where you make changes.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> When you upgrade <%= vars.product_short %>, you must place singleton jobs in the AZ you selected when you first installed the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile. You cannot move singleton jobs to another AZ.</p>

### <a id="apply-changes"></a>Apply Changes to the <%= vars.product_tile %> Tile

To complete the upgrade of the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile:

1. Return to the **Installation Dashboard** in Ops Manager.

1. Click **Review Pending Changes**.
     For more information about this Ops Manager page, see
    [Reviewing Pending Product Changes](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/customizing/review-pending-changes.html).

1. Click **Apply Changes**.

1. (Optional) To monitor the progress of the **Upgrade all clusters errand** using the BOSH CLI, do the following:
      1. Log in to the BOSH Director by running `bosh -e MY-ENVIRONMENT log-in` from a VM that can access your <%= vars.product_short %> deployment. For more information, see [Using BOSH Diagnostic Commands in <%= vars.product_short %>](diagnostic-tools.html).
      1. Run `bosh -e MY-ENVIRONMENT tasks`.
      1. Locate the task number for the errand in the <strong>&#35;</strong> column of the BOSH output.
      1. Run `bosh task TASK-NUMBER`, replacing `TASK-NUMBER` with the task number you located in the previous step.

## <a id="after-upgrade"></a>After the Upgrade
