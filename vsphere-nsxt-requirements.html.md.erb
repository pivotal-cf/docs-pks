This topic describes the version requirements for installing VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition (TKGI) on vSphere with NSX integration.  

For prerequisites and resource requirements for installing Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition on vSphere without NSX
integration, see

For hardware and resource requirements for deploying Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition on vSphere with NSX

Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition supports air-gapped deployments on vSphere with or without NSX integration.

You can also configure integration with the Harbor tile, an enterprise-class registry server for
container images. For more information, see
