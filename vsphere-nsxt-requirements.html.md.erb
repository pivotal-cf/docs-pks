This topic describes the version requirements for installing <%= vars.product_full %> (<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>) on vSphere with NSX integration.  

For prerequisites and resource requirements for installing <%= vars.product_short %> on vSphere without NSX
integration, see
[vSphere Prerequisites and Resource Requirements](vsphere-requirements.html).

For hardware and resource requirements for deploying <%= vars.product_short %> on vSphere with NSX
in production environments, see [Hardware Requirements for <%= vars.product_short %> on vSphere with NSX](./vsphere-nsxt-rpd-mpd.html).

<%= vars.product_short %> supports air-gapped deployments on vSphere with or without NSX integration.

You can also configure integration with the Harbor tile, an enterprise-class registry server for
container images. For more information, see
[VMware Harbor Registry](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Harbor-Registry/services/vmware-harbor-registry/GUID-index.html) in the
_VMware Partner documentation_.
