To access <%= vars.ops_manager %>:  

1. Collect the credentials needed to interact with <%= vars.ops_manager %>.  

    The <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> MC **Deployment Metadata** view displays the credentials that you need to log in to the deployed Operations Manager instance.

1. Click the clipboard icon at the end of the **Ops Manager VM SSH Private Key** row to copy its contents.

1. In a terminal run the following command to use SSH to connect to the Operations Manager VM:  

    ```
    ssh -i ~/pm_om.key ubuntu@END-POINT
    ```
    
    Where `END-POINT` is the Ops Manager endpoint address.
