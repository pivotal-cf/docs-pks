By assigning UAA scopes, you grant users the ability to create, manage, and audit Kubernetes clusters in <%= vars.product_short %>.

A UAA admin user can assign the following UAA scopes to <%= vars.product_short %> users:

  * `pks.clusters.admin`: Accounts with this scope can create and access all clusters.  
  * `pks.clusters.manage`: Accounts with this scope can create and access their own clusters.  
  * `pks.clusters.admin.read`: Accounts with this scope can access any information about all clusters except for cluster credentials.

You can assign these scopes to individual users, external identity provider groups, or clients for automation purposes.
