title: Connecting Enterprise PKS to an LDAP Server
owner: PKS

This topic describes how to connect <%= vars.product_full %>
to an external LDAP server.

## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

User Account and Authentication (UAA), the identity management
service for <%= vars.product_short %>, can
authenticate users either through its internal user account store or external
authentication mechanisms such as an LDAP server or a SAML identity provider.

To enable an internal user account store for UAA, you select **Internal UAA**
in the **<%= vars.product_tile %>** tile > **UAA**.

If you want to connect <%= vars.product_short %> to an external LDAP server, you
must integrate the UAA server with your LDAP server by following the
instructions in [Integrate UAA with an LDAP Server](#integrate) below.
This enables UAA to delegate authentication to your LDAP user store.

## <a id='integrate'></a>Integrate UAA with an LDAP Server

To integrate UAA with one or more LDAP servers:

1. In **<%= vars.product_tile %>** > **UAA**, under **Configure your UAA user
account store with either internal or external authentication mechanisms**,
select **LDAP Server**.

1. Under **Server URL**, enter the URLs that point to your LDAP server.
For example, `ldaps://example.com`.
If you have multiple LDAP servers, separate their URLs with spaces.
Each URL must include one of the following protocols:
    * `ldap://`: Enter this protocol if your LDAP server uses
    an unencrypted connection.
    * `ldaps://`: Enter this protocol if your LDAP server uses
    SSL for an encrypted connection.
    To support an encrypted connection,
    the LDAP server must hold a trusted certificate or
    you must import a trusted certificate to the JVM truststore.

1. Under **LDAP Credentials**, enter the LDAP Distinguished Name (DN) and
password for binding to the LDAP server.
For example, `cn=administrator,ou=Users,dc=example,dc=com`.
If the bind user belongs to a different search base, you must use the full DN.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> We recommend
    that you provide LDAP credentials that grant read-only permissions
    on the LDAP search base and the LDAP group search base.</p>

1. Under **User Search Base**, enter the location in the LDAP directory tree
where LDAP user search begins. For example, a domain named
`cloud.example.com` may use `ou=Users,dc=example,dc=com` as its LDAP user
search base.

1. Under **User Search Filter**, enter a string to use for
LDAP user search criteria. The search criteria allows LDAP to perform more
effective and efficient searches.
For example, the standard LDAP search filter `cn=Smith` returns all objects
with a common name equal to `Smith`.
<br><br>
In the LDAP search filter string that you use to configure
<%= vars.product_short %>, use `{0}` instead of the username. For example, use
`cn={0}` to return all LDAP objects with the same common name as the username.
In addition to `cn`, other common attributes are `mail`, `uid`, and
for Active Directory, `sAMAccountName`.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> For information about testing and
    troubleshooting your LDAP search filters, see
    <a href="https://community.pivotal.io/s/article/Configuring-LDAP-Integration-with-Pivotal-Cloud-Foundry">Configuring LDAP Integration with Pivotal Cloud Foundry</a>.</p>

1. Under **Group Search Base**, enter the location in the LDAP directory tree
where the LDAP group search begins. For example, a domain named
`cloud.example.com` may use `ou=Groups,dc=example,dc=com` as its LDAP group
search base.
You must configure **Group Search Base**
if you want to map an external LDAP group to a role in
<%= vars.product_short %> or a Kubernetes group.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> To map the groups under this
    search base to roles in <%= vars.product_short %>, follow the instructions
    in <a href="manage-users.html#external-group">Grant <%= vars.product_short %> Access to an External LDAP Group</a>.</p>

1. Under **Group Search Filter**, enter a string that defines LDAP group
search criteria. The default value is `member={0}`.

1. Under **Server SSL Cert**, paste in the root certificate from your CA
certificate or your self-signed certificate.

1. For **Server SSL Cert AltName**, do one of the following:
  * If you are using `ldaps://` with a self-signed certificate,
  enter a Subject Alternative Name (SAN) for your certificate.
  * If you are not using `ldaps://` with a self-signed certificate,
  leave this field blank.

1. Under **First Name Attribute**, enter the attribute name in your LDAP
directory that contains user first names. For example, `cn`.

1. Under **Last Name Attribute**, enter the attribute name in your LDAP
directory that contains user last names. For example, `sn`.

1. Under **Email Attribute**, enter the attribute name in your LDAP
directory that contains user email addresses. For example, `mail`.

1. Under **Email Domain(s)**, enter a comma-separated list of the email domains
for external users who can receive invitations to Apps Manager.

1. Under **LDAP Referrals**, choose how UAA handles LDAP server referrals to
other user stores. UAA can follow the external referrals, ignore them
without returning errors, or generate an error for each external referral and
abort the authentication.

1. Under **External Groups Whitelist**, enter a comma-separated list of group
patterns that need to be populated in the user's `id_token`. For more
information about accepted patterns, see the description of
`config.externalGroupsWhitelist` in the OAuth/OIDC
[Identity Provider Documentation](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/api/uaa/version/4.19.0/index.html#oauth-oidc).
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: When sent as a Bearer token in the
Authentication header, wide pattern queries for users who are members of
multiple groups can cause the size of the <code>id_token</code> to extend
beyond what is supported by web servers.</p>
