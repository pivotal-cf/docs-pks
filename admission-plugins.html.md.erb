owner: TKGI
---

The topics below describe how to manage and use admission control plugins for VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition (TKGI) clusters.  

For more information about Admission Controllers, see [Using Admission Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/) in the Kubernetes documentation.

For details on the admission control plugins supported by TKGI, see:  

* [Enabling the PodSecurityAdmission Plugin for Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition Clusters and Using Pod Security Admission](./pod-security-admission.html)  
* [Enabling the SecurityContextDeny Admission Plugin for Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition Clusters](./security-context-deny.html)  
    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Support for SecurityContextDeny admission controller has been removed in TKGI v1.18. The SecurityContextDeny admission controller has been deprecated, and the Kubernetes community recommends the controller not be used. 
    Pod security admission (PSA) is the preferred method for providing a more secure Kubernetes environment. For more information about PSA, see <a href="pod-security-admission.html">Pod Security Admission in TKGI</a>.
