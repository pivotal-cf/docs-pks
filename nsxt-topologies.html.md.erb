There are three supported topologies in which to deploy NSX-T with PKS.

##<a id='topology-nat'></a> NAT Topology

The following figure shows a Network Address Translation (NAT) deployment:

This topology has the following characteristics:

* PKS control plane (Ops Manager, BOSH Director, and PKS VM) components are all located on a logical switch that has undergone Network Address Translation on a T0.
* Kubernetes cluster master and worker nodes are located on a logical switch 
that has undergone Network Address Translation on a T0. This requires DNAT rules to allow access to Kubernetes APIs.

##<a id='topology-no-nat-virtual-switch'></a> No-NAT with Virtual Switch (VSS/VDS) Topology

The following figure shows a No-NAT with Virtual Switch (VSS/VDS) deployment:

This topology has the following characteristics:

* PKS control plane (Ops Manager, BOSH Director, and PKS VM) components are using corporate routable IP addresses.
* Kubernetes cluster master and worker nodes are using corporate routable IP addresses.
* The PKS control plane is deployed outside of the NSX-T network and the Kubernetes clusters are deployed and managed within the NSX-T network. Since BOSH needs routable access to the Kubernetes Nodes to monitor and manage them, the Kubernetes Nodes need routable access.

##<a id='topology-no-nat-logical-switch'></a> No-NAT with Logical Switch (NSX-T) Topology

The following figure shows a No-NAT with Logical Switch (NSX-T) deployment:

This topology has the following characteristics:

* PKS control plane (Ops Manager, BOSH Director, and PKS VM) components are using corporate routable IP addresses.
* Kubernetes cluster master and worker nodes are using corporate routable IP addresses.
* The PKS control plane is deployed inside of the NSX-T network. Both the PKS control plane components (VMs) and the Kubernetes Nodes use corporate routable IP addresses.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: PKS does not support the use of NSX-T edge clusters on bare metal.</p>
