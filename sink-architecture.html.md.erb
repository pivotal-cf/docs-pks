This topic describes how <%= vars.product_full %>
(<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>) implements sinks for collecting logs and
metrics from Kubernetes worker nodes and workloads.  

For step-by-step instructions on creating sinks in <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>,
see [Creating and Managing Sink Resources](./create-sinks.html).

## <a id="overview"></a> Overview

A sink collects logs or metrics about Kubernetes worker nodes in a
<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> deployment and workloads that are running on them.

For more information, see:

* [Sink Types](#types) below
* [Sink Architecture](#architecture) below

## <a id="types"></a>Sink Types

You can create two types of sinks:

* Log sinks
* Metric sinks

See the table below for information about these sink types.

<%= partial 'sink-resources' %>

## <a id="architecture"></a>Sink Architecture

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>-provisioned Kubernetes clusters include an
observability manager that manages log sink and metric sink configurations
within a cluster.

The following diagram details <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> cluster observability architecture:

In the **<%= vars.product_tile %>** tile > **In-Cluster Monitoring**:

- **Enable Metric Sink Resources** enables metric sinks.
- **Enable Log Sink Resources** enables log sinks.
- **Enable node exporter on workers** forwards additional infrastructure metrics.

Setting these check boxes in Ops Manager directs how BOSH configures the observability manager.

For more information about enabling log sinks and metrics sinks,
see [(Optional) In-Cluster Monitoring](./installing-vsphere.html#cluster-monitoring) in the _Installing_ topic for your IaaS.
  
### <a id="log-architecture"></a> Log Sink Architecture

The <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> log sink aggregates workload logs and forwards them to a common log destination.

The following diagram details <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> log sink architecture:

![Log sink architecture in <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>.](images/log-architecture.png)

<%#<a href="images/log-architecture.png" target="_blank" id="log-sink-diagram"><img src="images/log-architecture.png" alt="Log sink architecture in <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %   >"></a>    #%>
<%#= original graphic is here https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xFhfrNPPKrSts4U4HsAZAl1pWuHkhq4vXWN8gLGY3G8/edit#slide=id.g5df94f27fe_0_397 %  > #%>

Logs are monitored and aggregated by a Fluent Bit `DaemonSet` running as a pod on each worker node.

An event-controller collects Kubernetes API events and sends them to a second Fluent Bit daemon pod for aggregation.

All aggregated log entries are marshaled to a common log destination.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: When sinks are added or removed, all of the Fluent Bit pods are refreshed with new sink information.</p>

### <a id="metric-architecture"></a> Metric Sink Architecture

The <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> metric sink aggregates workload metrics and forwards them to a common metrics destination.

The following diagram details <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> metric sink architecture:

A metric sink collects and writes metrics from a cluster to specified outputs using input and output plugins.

Workload metrics are monitored by a set of third-party plugins. The plugins forward the metrics to a Telegraf service pod. 

A pair of kubelets monitors Kubernetes and forwards Kubernetes metrics to a pair of Telegraf service pods. 

If Node Exporter is enabled on the worker nodes in the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile, a Node Exporter `DaemonSet` is included in all clusters.
For more information about Node Exporter metrics, see the [Node Exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter#enabled-by-default) repository in GitHub.

To define the collected unstructured metrics, a metric-controller monitors Kubernetes for custom resource definitions and forwards those definitions 
to the Telegraf services.

The Telegraf services collect, process, and aggregate gathered metrics. All aggregated metrics are marshaled 
to an additional plugin for forwarding to a third-party application. 

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: When sinks are added or removed, all of the Telegraf pods are refreshed with new sink information.</p>
