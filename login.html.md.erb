This topic describes how to log in to Pivotal Container Service (PKS).

## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

To manage PKS-deployed clusters, you use the PKS Command
Line Interface (CLI). When you log in to PKS successfully
for the first time, the PKS CLI generates a local `creds.yml` file that contains
the API endpoint, refresh token, access token, and CA certificate, if applicable.

By default, `creds.yml` is saved in the `~/.pks` directory on your local system.
You can use the `PKS_HOME` environment variable to override this location and
store `creds.yml` in any directory on your system.

## <a id='prerequisites'></a>Prerequisites

Before you can log in to PKS, you must have the following:

- A running PKS environment. See the _Installing PKS_
section for your cloud provider.
- The PKS CLI installed on your local system. See [Installing the PKS CLI](installing-pks-cli.html).
- A username and password that has access to the PKS API. See [Configuring PKS API Access](configure-api.html).

## <a id='login'></a>Log in to the PKS CLI

Use the command in this section to log in as an individual user.
The login procedure is the same for users created in UAA or users from external LDAP groups.

On the command line, run the following command in your terminal to log in to the PKS CLI:

<pre>
pks login -a PKS-API -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD --ca-cert CERT-PATH
</pre>

Replace the placeholder values in the command as follows:

* `PKS-API` is the domain name for the PKS API that you entered in **Ops Manager** > **Pivotal Container Service** > **PKS API** > **API Hostname (FQDN)**.
For example, `api.pks.example.com`.

* `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD` belong to the account you created in the [Grant PKS Access to a User](manage-users.html#uaa-user) section of _Managing Users in PKS with UAA_.
If you do not use `-p` to provide a password, the PKS CLI prompts for the password interactively.
Pivotal recommends running the login command without the `-p` flag for added security.

* `CERT-PATH` is the path to your root CA certificate.
Provide the certificate to validate the PKS API certificate with SSL.<br><br>
For example:
  <pre class="terminal">
  $ pks login -a api.pks.example.com -u alana \
  --ca-cert /var/tempest/workspaces/default/root&#95;ca&#95;certificate
  </pre>

    If you are logging in to a trusted environment, you can use `-k` to skip SSL verification instead of `--ca-cert CERT-PATH`.<br><br>
    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ pks login -a api.pks.example.com -u alana -k
