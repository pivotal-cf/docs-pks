title: Monitoring PKS with Sinks
owner: PKS
---

This topic describes how to monitor Pivotal Container Service (PKS) workloads using sink resources.

## <a id="prerequisites"></a> Prerequisites

Using sink resources for monitoring requires that you have set up a log processing solution capable 
of log ingress over TCP as described in [RFC 5424](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5424). 

In addition, you must configure sinks in PKS to send logs to that destination. 
For information on how to create and manage sinks in PKS, see [Creating Sink Resources](./create-sinks.html).

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Sinks created in PKS only support TCP connections. 
UDP connections are not currently supported.</p>

## <a id="distinguish"></a> About Sink Log Entries

Sinks and ClusterSinks include both pod logs as well as events from the Kubernetes API. 

These logs and events are combined in a shared format to provide operators with a 
robust set of filtering and monitoring options. 

Sink data has the following characteristics. All entries:

* Are timestamped.
* Contain the host ID of the BOSH-defined VM.
* Are annotated with a set of structured data, which includes the namespace, the object name or pod ID, and the container name. 

### <a id="log-format"></a> Sink Log Entry Format

All sink log entries use the following format:

```
APP-NAME/NAMESPACE/POD-ID/CONTAINER-NAME
```

Where:

  * `APP-NAME` is `pod.log` or `k8s.event`.
  * `NAMESPACE` is the namespace associated with the pod log or Kubernetes event.
  * `POD-ID` is the ID of the pod associated with the pod log or Kubernetes event.
  * `CONTAINER-NAME` is the workload associated with the pod log or Kubernetes event.


## <a id="pod-logs"></a> Pod Logs

Pod logs entries are distinguished by the string `pod.log` in the `APP-NAME` field. 

### <a id="pod-log-example"></a> Pod Log Example

The following is a sample pod log entry:

<pre>
36 <14>1 2018-11-26T18:51:41.647825+00:00 vm-3ebfe45d-492d-4bfd-59c4-c45d91688c65 
pod.log/rocky-raccoon/logspewer-6b58b6689d-dhddj - - [kubernetes@47450 
app="logspewer" pod-template-hash="2614622458" namespace_name="rocky-raccoon" 
object_name="logspewer-6b58b6689d-dhddj" container_name="logspewer"] 
2018/11/26 18:51:41 Log Message 589910
</pre>

Where:

  * `vm-3ebfe45d-492d-4bfd-59c4-c45d91688c65` is the host ID of the BOSH VM.
  * `pod.log` is the `APP-NAME`.
  * `rocky-raccoon` is the `NAMESPACE`.
  * `logspewer-6b58b6689d-dhddj` is the `POD-ID`.


## <a id="k8s-api"></a> Kubernetes API Events

Kubernetes API Event entries are distinguished by the string `k8s.event` in the `APP-NAME` field. 

### <a id="k8s-api-example"></a> Kubernetes API Event Example

The following is an example Kubernetes API event log entry:

<pre>
Nov 14 16:01:49 vm-b409c60e-2517-47ac-7c5b-2cd302287c3a 
k8s.event/rocky-raccoon/logspewer-6b58b6689d-j9n: 
Successfully assigned rocky-raccoon/logspewer-6b58b6689d-j9nq7 
to vm-38dfd896-bb21-43e4-67b0-9d2f339adaf1
</pre>

Where:

  * `vm-b409c60e-2517-47ac-7c5b-2cd302287c3a` the host ID of the BOSH VM.
  * `k8s.event` is the `APP-NAME`.
  * `rocky-raccoon` is the `NAMESPACE`.
  * `logspewer-6b58b6689d-j9n` is the `POD-ID`.


### <a id="important-events"></a> Notable Kubernetes API Events

The following section lists Kubernetes API Events that can help assess any Kubernetes scheduling problems in PKS. 

To monitor for these events, look for log entries that contain the <strong>Identifying String</strong> indicated below for each event.

####<a id="imagepullbackoff"></a> Failure to Retrieve Containers from Registry

<table>
   <tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align: center;"><br>ImagePullBackOff<br><br></th></tr>
   <tr>
      <th width="25%">Description</th>
      <td>Image pull back offs occur when the Kubernetes API cannot reach a registry to retrieve a container or the container does not exist in the registry. The scheduler might be trying to access a registry that is not available on the network. For example, Docker Hub is blocked by a firewall. Other reasons might include the registry is experiencing an outage or a specified container has been deleted or was never uploaded.</td>
