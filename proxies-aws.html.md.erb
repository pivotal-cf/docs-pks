title: Using Proxies with Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition on AWS

This topic describes how HTTP/HTTPS proxies work in VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition (TKGI) on AWS,
and how to set proxies globally.  

To configure proxy settings specifically for individual TKGI clusters, see [Configure Cluster Proxies](proxies-cluster.html).


##<a id='overview'></a>Overview

If your environment includes HTTP proxies, you can configure Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition 
on AWS to use these proxies so that Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition-deployed Kubernetes 
control plane and worker nodes access public Internet services and other internal services through a proxy.  

In addition, Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition proxy settings apply to the TKGI API instance.
When an Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition operator creates a Kubernetes cluster, 
the TKGI API VM behind a proxy is able to manage AWS components on the standard network.

You can also proxy outgoing HTTP/HTTPS traffic from Ops Manager and the BOSH Director so that all 
Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition components use the same proxy service.

The following diagram illustrates the network architecture:

To configure a global HTTP proxy for all outgoing HTTP/HTTPS traffic from the Kubernetes cluster nodes and the TKGI API server, perform the following steps:

1. Navigate to Ops Manager and log in.

1. Click the **Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition** tile.

1. Click **Networking**.
1. Under **HTTP/HTTPS Proxy**, select **Enabled** to configure an Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition global proxy 
for all outgoing HTTP and HTTPS traffic from your Kubernetes clusters.  
<%= partial 'global-proxy' %>
1. To save your changes to the TKGI tile, click **Save**.  
1. Proceed with any remaining Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition tile configurations and deploy Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition.
