title: Service Interruptions
owner: TKGI
---

This topic describes events in the lifecycle of a Kubernetes cluster deployed by <%= vars.product_full %> that can cause temporary service interruptions.

## <a id='service-update'></a>Stemcell or Service Update

An operator performs a stemcell version update or <%= vars.product_short %> version update.

### Impact
- **Workload**: If you run the recommended configuration, no workload downtime is expected since the VMs are upgraded one at a time.
For more information, see [Maintaining Workload Uptime](maintain-uptime.html).
- **Kubernetes control plane**: The Kubernetes control plane VM is recreated during the upgrade, so `kubectl` and the Kubernetes control plane experience a short downtime.

### Required Actions
None. If the update deploys successfully, the Kubernetes control plane recovers automatically.

## <a id='process-fail-master'></a>VM Process Failure on a Cluster Control Plane

A process, such as the scheduler or the Kubernetes API server, crashes on the cluster control plane VM.

### Impact
- **Workload**: If the scheduler crashes, workloads that are in the process of being rescheduled may experience up to 120 seconds of downtime.
- **Kubernetes control plane**: Depending on the process and what it was doing when it crashed, the Kubernetes control plane may experience 60-120 seconds of downtime.
Until the process resumes, the following can occur:
  - Developers may be unable to deploy workloads
  - Metrics or logging may stop
  - Other features may be interrupted

### Required Actions
None. BOSH brings the process back automatically using `monit`.
If the process resumes cleanly and without manual intervention, the Kubernetes control plane recovers automatically.

## <a id='process-fail-worker'></a>VM Process Failure on a Cluster Worker

A process, such as Docker or `kube-proxy`, crashes on a cluster worker VM.

###Impact
- **Workload**: If the cluster and workloads follow the recommended configuration for the number of workers, replica sets, and pod anti-affinity rules, workloads should not experience downtime.
The Kubernetes scheduler reschedules the affected pods on other workers.
For more information, see [Maintaining Workload Uptime](maintain-uptime.html).

### Required Actions
None. BOSH brings the process back automatically using `monit`.
If the process resumes cleanly and without manual intervention, the worker recovers automatically, and the scheduler resumes scheduling new pods on this worker.

## <a id='process-fail-tkgi'></a>VM Process Failure on the <%= vars.control_plane %> VM

A process, such as the <%= vars.control_plane %> server, crashes on the pivotal-container-service VM.

### Impact
- **<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> control plane**: Depending on the process and what it was doing, the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> control plane may experience 60-120 seconds of downtime.
Until the process resumes, the following can occur:
  - The <%= vars.control_plane %> or UAA may be inaccessible
  - Use of the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> CLI is interrupted
  - Metrics or logging may stop
  - Other features may be interrupted

### Required Actions
None. BOSH brings the process back automatically using `monit`.
If the process resumes cleanly, the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> control plane recovers automatically and the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> CLI resumes working.

## <a id='vm-fail'></a>VM Failure

An <%= vars.product_short %> VM fails and goes offline due to either a virtualization problem or a host hardware problem.

### Impact

- **If the BOSH Resurrector is enabled**, BOSH detects the failure, recreates the VM, and reattaches the same persistent disk and IP address.
Downtime depends on which VM goes offline, how quickly the BOSH Resurrector notices, and how long it takes the IaaS to create a replacement VM. The BOSH Resurrector usually notices an offline VM within one to two minutes.
For more information about the BOSH Resurrector, see the [BOSH documentation](https://bosh.io/docs/resurrector.html).

- **If the BOSH Resurrector is not enabled**, some cloud providers, such as vSphere, have similar resurrection or high availability (HA) features.
Depending on the VM, the impact can be similar to a key process on that VM going down as described in the previous sections, but the recovery time is longer while the replacement VM is created.
See the documentation for process failures in the [cluster worker](#process-fail-worker), [cluster control plane](#process-fail-master), and [<%= vars.control_plane %> VM](#process-fail-tkgi) sections for more information.

### Required Actions
When the VM comes back online, no further action is required for the developer to continue operations.

## <a id='az-fail'></a>AZ Failure

An availability zone (AZ) goes offline entirely or loses connectivity to other AZs (net split).

### Impact
The control plane and clusters are inaccessible.
The extent of the downtime is unknown.

### Required Actions
When the AZ comes back online, the control plane recovers in one of the following ways:

* **If BOSH is in a different AZ**, BOSH recreates the VMs with the last known persistent disks and IPs.
If the persistent disks are gone, the disks can be restored from your last backup and reattached.
<%= vars.recommended_by %> recommends manually checking the state of VMs and databases.

* **If BOSH is in the same AZ**, follow the directions for [region failure](#region-fail).

## <a id='region-fail'></a>Region Failure

An entire region fails, bringing all <%= vars.product_short %> components offline.

### Impact
The entire <%= vars.product_short %> deployment and all services are unavailable.
The extent of the downtime is unknown.

### Required Actions
The <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> control plane can be restored using BOSH Backup and Restore (BBR).
Each cluster may need to be restored manually from backups.

For more information, see [Restore <%= vars.product_short %> Control Plane](bbr-restore.html#redeploy-restore-control-plane) in _Restoring <%= vars.product_short %>_.
