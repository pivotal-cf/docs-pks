title: Upgrade Scenarios for Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition v1.8 on vSphere
owner: TKGI
---

This topic provides examples of upgrade scenarios for
<%= vars.product_full %> installations that are upgraded from
v1.7 to v1.8 on vSphere.

## <a id="overview"></a>Overview

You can deploy <%= vars.product_short %> on
vSphere with either NSX-T or Flannel networking.

* For examples of upgrade scenarios with NSX-T
networking, see
[<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> on vSphere with NSX-T Networking](#nsxt) below.
* For examples of upgrade scenarios with
Flannel networking, see
[<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> on vSphere with Flannel Networking](#flannel)
below.

## <a id="nsxt"></a><%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> on vSphere with NSX-T Networking

When upgrading <%= vars.product_short %> on vSphere with NSX-T networking,
you can choose one of the following upgrade scenarios:

* Upgrade <%= vars.product_short %> only and do not upgrade your NSX-T or
vSphere infrastructure. For example, see
[Scenario 1: Upgrading <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> to v1.8](#tkgi-only) below.
* Upgrade <%= vars.product_short %> and NSX-T infrastructure. For example, see
[Scenario 2: Upgrading to <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.8 and NSX-T v3.0](#tkgi-nsxt)
below.
* Upgrade <%= vars.product_short %>, NSX-T, and vSphere
infrastructure. For example, see
[Scenario 3: Upgrading to <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.8, NSX-T v3.0, and vSphere v7.0](#tkgi-nsxt-vsphere)
below.

    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Upgrading <%= vars.product_short %> often
    includes upgrading your Ops Manager.</p>

For a list of NSX-T and vSphere versions compatible with
<%= vars.product_short %> v1.8, see:

* [Product Snapshot](release-notes.html) in _Release Notes_
* [VMware Product Interoperability Matrices](https://www.vmware.com/resources/compatibility/sim/interop_matrix.php#interop&356=&175=&1=)

### <a id="tkgi-only"></a>Scenario 1: Upgrading <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> to v1.8

In this upgrade scenario, you upgrade <%= vars.product_short %>
from v1.7 to v1.8 and do not upgrade your NSX-T or vSphere infrastructure.

The upgrade scenario includes the following steps:

1. (Optional) Upgrade Ops Manager.
2. Upgrade <%= vars.product_short %> from v1.7 to v1.8.

See the table below for version information and instructions for this
upgrade scenario:

    <tr>
        <td>Ops Manager</td>
        <td>2.7, 2.8, or 2.9</td>
        <td>2.7, 2.8, or 2.9</td>
        <td>Check <a href="https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-container-service/">Tanzu Network</a>
        for patch compatibility.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %></td>
        <td>1.7</td>
        <td>1.8</td>
        <td>See <a href="upgrade-nsxt.html">Upgrading Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition (NSX-T Networking)</a>.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>NSX-T<sup>&#42;</sup></td>
        <td>2.5.0 or 2.5.1</td>
        <td>2.5.0 or 2.5.1</td>
        <td><em>n/a</em></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>vSphere</td>
        <td>6.5 or 6.7</td>
        <td>6.5 or 6.7</td>
        <td><em>n/a</em></td>
    </tr>
</table>

<sup>&#42;</sup> The scenario described in this section assumes that your
Enterprise PKS v1.7 environment is running with NSX-T v2.5.
If you have not already done so, upgrade to NSX-T v2.5 before following this
upgrade scenario. <%= vars.product_short %> v1.8 does not support NSX-T v2.4.
See:

* [Product Snapshot](release-notes.html) in _Release Notes_ for a list of
NSX-T 2.5 versions compatible with <%= vars.product_short %> v1.8
* [Upgrade NSX-T Data Center v2.4.3 to v2.5](https://docs.pivotal.io/pks/1-7/upgrade-pks-nsxt.html#upgrade-nsxt)
in the Enterprise PKS v1.7 documentation

### <a id="tkgi-nsxt"></a>Scenario 2: Upgrading to <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.8 and NSX-T v3.0

In this upgrade scenario, you upgrade <%= vars.product_short %> from v1.7 to
v1.8 and NSX-T from v2.5.0 or v2.5.1 to v3.0.

The upgrade scenario includes the following steps:

1. Upgrade Ops Manager to v2.9.
1. Upgrade <%= vars.product_short %> from v1.7 to v1.8.
1. Upgrade all <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>-provisioned clusters to v1.8.
This upgrades the NCP version of your clusters to 3.0.1.
1. Upgrade NSX-T from v2.5.0 or v2.5.1 to v3.0.

upgrade scenario:

## <a id="flannel"></a><%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> on vSphere with Flannel Networking
