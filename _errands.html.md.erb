Errands are scripts that run at designated points during an installation.  

To configure which post-deploy and pre-delete errands run for 
<%= vars.product_short %>:

1. Make a selection in the dropdown next to each errand.  
<% if current_page.data.iaas == "vSphere-NSX-T" %>
    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: We recommend that you use the 
    default settings for all errands except for the <strong>NSX-T validation</strong> 
    and <strong>Run smoke tests</strong> errands.
    </p> 
<% else %>
    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: We recommend that you use the 
    	default settings for all errands except for the **Run smoke tests** errand.
    </p> 
<% end %>
<% if current_page.data.iaas == "vSphere-NSX-T" %>
1. (Optional) Set the **NSX-T validation** errand to **On**.  
<br>
    This errand verifies the NSX-T objects.
<% end %>
1. (Optional) Set the **Run smoke tests** errand to **On**.  

    This errand uses the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> CLI to create a Kubernetes cluster and then delete it.
    If the creation or deletion fails, the errand fails and the installation 
    of the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile is aborted.  
<% if current_page.data.iaas == "vSphere-NSX-T" %>
1. (Optional) If you have activated the **Run smoke tests** errand, 
        you can configure the errand to use a network profile to create the test cluster. 
        By default, the smoke test errand creates a cluster using the configuration settings on the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> tile. 
        To configure the smoke test errand to use a network profile, create a network profile with your preferred smoke test settings and configure **Errand Settings** > **Smoke tests - Network Profile Name** with the network profile name.  
<% end %>

1. (Optional) To ensure that all of your cluster VMs are patched, 
    configure the **Upgrade all clusters errand** errand to **On**.  
<br>
    Updating the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile with a new 
	Linux stemcell and the **Upgrade all clusters errand** enabled 
	triggers the rolling of every Linux VM in each Kubernetes cluster. 
	Similarly, updating the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile with a new Windows stemcell triggers 
	the rolling of every Windows VM in your Kubernetes clusters.  
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> <%= vars.recommended_by %> recommends that you 
    review the Tanzu Network metadata and confirm stemcell version compatibility before using 
    the Tanzu Network APIs to update the stemcells in your automated pipeline.
