title: Using BOSH Diagnostic Commands in Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition
owner: Ops Manager
---

This topic describes how to access information about your <%= vars.product_full %> (<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>) deployment
by using the BOSH Command Line Interface (BOSH CLI).

<br>
<br>
## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

BOSH diagnostic commands such as `bosh ssh` and `bosh vms` enable
you to access information about your <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> deployment.
For example, you can access <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> log files
after SSHing into the <%= vars.control_plane %> or a Kubernetes cluster VM:

1. [Log in to the BOSH Director VM](#alias)  
1. SSH into the environment:  
    * [SSH into the <%= vars.control_plane %> VM](#tkgi-api)  
    * [SSH into the <%= vars.control_plane_db %> VM](#pks-db)  
    * [SSH into a Kubernetes Cluster VM](#cluster)  
1. [View Log Files](#bosh-tkgi-map)

<br>
<br>
## <a id='alias'></a> Log in to the BOSH Director VM

To set a BOSH alias for your <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> environment
and log in to the BOSH Director VM, follow the steps below:

1. Gather your credential and IP address information for the BOSH Director and SSH
into the Ops Manager VM. For instructions, see [Advanced Troubleshooting with the BOSH
CLI](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Operations-Manager/3.0/vmware-tanzu-ops-manager/install-trouble-advanced.html).
1. To create a BOSH alias for your <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> environment, run the following command:  

    ```
    bosh alias-env ENVIRONMENT \
    -e BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP \
    --ca-cert /var/tempest/workspaces/default/root_ca_certificate
    ```
    Where:  

    * `ENVIRONMENT` is an alias of your choice. For example, `tkgi`.  
    * `BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP` is the BOSH Director IP address you located in the
    first step. For example, `10.0.0.3`.  

    For example:  
    ```console
    $ bosh alias-env tkgi -e 10.0.0.3 \
    --ca-cert /var/tempest/workspaces/default/root_ca_certificate
    ```
1. To log in to the BOSH Director using the alias you set, run the following command:
    
    ```
    bosh -e ENVIRONMENT login
    ```

    For example:  
    ```console
    $ bosh -e tkgi login
    ```
    Alternatively, you can set the BOSH environment variables on the Ops Manager VM to authenticate with the BOSH Director VM.
    For more information, see [Authenticate with the BOSH Director VM](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Operations-Manager/3.0/vmware-tanzu-ops-manager/install-trouble-advanced.html#log-in) in
    _Advanced Troubleshooting with the BOSH CLI_ in the Ops Manager documentation.

## <a id='tkgi-api'></a>SSH into the <%= vars.control_plane %> VM

To SSH into the <%= vars.control_plane %> VM using the BOSH CLI, follow the steps below:

<%= partial 'bosh-ssh-api' %>

<br>
<br>
## <a id='pks-db'></a>SSH into the <%= vars.control_plane_db %> VM

To SSH into a <%= vars.control_plane_db %> VM using the BOSH CLI, follow the steps below:

<%= partial 'bosh-ssh-db' %>

<br>
<br>
## <a id='cluster'></a>SSH into a Kubernetes Cluster VM

Each Kubernetes cluster corresponds to a BOSH deployment.
To SSH into a <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>-provisioned Kubernetes cluster VM using the BOSH CLI, follow the steps below:

<%= partial 'ssh-cluster-master-node' %>

<br>
<br>
## <a id='bosh-tkgi-map'></a>View Log Files

Log files contain error messages and other information you can use to diagnose issues
with your <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> deployment.
To access <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> log files,
SSH into the <%= vars.control_plane %> VM, or a Kubernetes cluster VM, and then follow the steps below:

1. To act as super user on your VM, run the following command:  

    ```console
    sudo su
    ```

1. Navigate to the `/var/vcap/sys/log` log file directory:  

  ```console
  cd /var/vcap/sys/log
  ```

1. Examine the contents of the `/var/vcap/sys/log` directory.
For example, when diagnosing issues with a Kubernetes cluster VM, you might want to review the following log files:
  * On a control plane VM, examine the `kube-apiserver` subdirectory.
  * On a worker VM, examine the `kubelet` subdirectory.
