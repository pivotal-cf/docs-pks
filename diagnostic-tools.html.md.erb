title: Using BOSH Diagnostic Commands in Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition
owner: Ops Manager
---

This topic describes how to access information about your VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition (TKGI) deployment
by using the BOSH Command Line Interface (BOSH CLI).

<br>
<br>
## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

BOSH diagnostic commands such as `bosh ssh` and `bosh vms` enable
you to access information about your TKGI deployment.
For example, you can access TKGI log files
after SSHing into the TKGI API or a Kubernetes cluster VM:

1. [Log in to the BOSH Director VM](#alias)  
1. SSH into the environment:  
    * [SSH into the TKGI API VM](#tkgi-api)  
    * [SSH into the TKGI Database VM](#pks-db)  
    * [SSH into a Kubernetes Cluster VM](#cluster)  
1. [View Log Files](#bosh-tkgi-map)

<br>

## <a id='alias'></a> Log in to the BOSH Director VM

To set a BOSH alias for your TKGI environment
and log in to the BOSH Director VM, follow the steps below:

1. Gather your credential and IP address information for the BOSH Director and SSH
into the Ops Manager VM. For instructions, see [Advanced Troubleshooting with the BOSH
CLI](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Operations-Manager/3.0/vmware-tanzu-ops-manager/install-trouble-advanced.html).
1. To create a BOSH alias for your TKGI environment, run the following command:  

    ```
    bosh alias-env ENVIRONMENT \
    -e BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP \
    --ca-cert /var/tempest/workspaces/default/root_ca_certificate
    ```
    Where:  

    * `ENVIRONMENT` is an alias of your choice. For example, `tkgi`.  
    * `BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP` is the BOSH Director IP address you located in the
    first step. For example, `10.0.0.3`.  

    For example:  
    ```console
    $ bosh alias-env tkgi -e 10.0.0.3 \
    --ca-cert /var/tempest/workspaces/default/root_ca_certificate
    ```
1. To log in to the BOSH Director using the alias you set, run the following command:
    
    ```
    bosh -e ENVIRONMENT login
    ```

    For example:  
    ```console
    $ bosh -e tkgi login
    ```
    Alternatively, you can set the BOSH environment variables on the Ops Manager VM to authenticate with the BOSH Director VM.
    For more information, see [Authenticate with the BOSH Director VM](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Operations-Manager/3.0/vmware-tanzu-ops-manager/install-trouble-advanced.html#log-in) in
    _Advanced Troubleshooting with the BOSH CLI_ in the Ops Manager documentation.

## <a id='tkgi-api'></a>SSH into the TKGI API VM

To SSH into the TKGI API VM using the BOSH CLI, follow the steps below:

<%= partial 'bosh-ssh-api' %>

<br>
<br>
## <a id='pks-db'></a>SSH into the TKGI Database VM

To SSH into a TKGI Database VM using the BOSH CLI, follow the steps below:

<%= partial 'bosh-ssh-db' %>

<br>
<br>
## <a id='cluster'></a>SSH into a Kubernetes Cluster VM

Each Kubernetes cluster corresponds to a BOSH deployment.
To SSH into a TKGI-provisioned Kubernetes cluster VM using the BOSH CLI, follow the steps below:

<%= partial 'ssh-cluster-master-node' %>

<br>
<br>
## <a id='bosh-tkgi-map'></a>View Log Files

Log files contain error messages and other information you can use to diagnose issues
with your TKGI deployment.
To access TKGI log files,
SSH into the TKGI API VM, or a Kubernetes cluster VM, and then follow the steps below:

1. To act as super user on your VM, run the following command:  

    ```console
    sudo su
    ```

1. Navigate to the `/var/vcap/sys/log` log file directory:  

  ```console
  cd /var/vcap/sys/log
  ```

1. Examine the contents of the `/var/vcap/sys/log` directory.
For example, when diagnosing issues with a Kubernetes cluster VM, you might want to review the following log files:
  * On a control plane VM, examine the `kube-apiserver` subdirectory.
  * On a worker VM, examine the `kubelet` subdirectory.
