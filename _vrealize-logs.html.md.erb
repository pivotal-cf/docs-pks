vRealize Log Insight provides intelligent log management for infrastructure and applications. 
For information about vRealize Log Insight, see [vRealize Log Insight documentation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/vRealize-Log-Insight/index.html).  

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Before enabling and configuring vRLI integration, you must have a vRLI license and vRLI must be installed, running, and available in your environment.</p>

By default, vRLI logging is deactivated. To configure vRLI logging:  

1. Under **Enable VMware vRealize Log Insight Integration?**, select **Yes**.

1. Under **Host**, enter the IP address or FQDN of the vRLI host. 
You must provide the instance address for an installed and running vRLI instance.  
1. (Optional) Select the **Enable SSL?** checkbox to encrypt the logs being sent to vRLI using SSL.  
1. Choose one of the following SSL certificate validation options:  

    * To skip certificate validation for the vRLI host, select the **Disable SSL certificate validation** checkbox. 
    Select this option if you are using a self-signed certificate in order to simplify setup for a development or test environment.  
    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Deactivating certificate validation is not recommended for production environments.</p>  
    * To enable certificate validation for the vRLI host, clear the **Disable SSL certificate validation** checkbox.  

1. (Optional) If your vRLI certificate is not signed by a trusted CA root or other well known certificate, enter the certificate in the **CA certificate** field. Locate the PEM of the CA used to sign the vRLI certificate, copy the contents of the certificate file, and paste them into the field. Certificates must be in PEM-encoded format.  
1. Under **Rate limiting**, enter a time in milliseconds to change the rate at which logs are sent to the vRLI host. The rate limit specifies the minimum time between messages before the fluentd agent begins to drop messages. The default value `0` means that the rate is not limited, which suffices for many deployments.  
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If your deployment is generating a high volume of logs, you can increase this value to limit network traffic. Consider starting with a lower value, such as <code>10</code>, then tuning to optimize for your deployment. A large number might result in dropping too many log entries.</p>  
1. Click **Save**. These settings apply to any clusters created after you have saved these configuration settings and clicked **Apply Changes**. If the **Upgrade all clusters errand** has been enabled, these settings are also applied to existing clusters.  
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The <%= vars.product_tile %> tile does not validate your vRLI configuration settings. To verify your setup, look for log entries in vRLI.</p>
