This topic describes the prerequisites and resource requirements for installing <%= vars.product_full %> on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

##<a id='prerequisites'></a> Prerequisites

You can install <%= vars.product_short %> on GCP manually.

Complete the following before deploying <%= vars.product_short %>:

1. Review [Resource Requirements](#resources) below.
1. Install and configure Ops Manager. To install and configure Ops Manager,
follow the instructions in [Installing and Configuring Ops Manager on GCP](gcp-om-install-config.html).
1. Create service accounts for Kubernetes control plane and worker nodes.
To create the service accounts,
follow the instructions in [Creating Service Accounts in GCP for <%= vars.product_short %>](gcp-service-accounts.html).
  <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Perform this step after you install and configure Ops Manager.</p>
1. Create a load balancer to access the <%= vars.control_plane %> from outside the network
and run `tkgi` commands from your local workstation. To create a load balancer in GCP, follow the instructions in
[Creating a GCP Load Balancer for the <%= vars.control_plane %>](./gcp-api-load-balancer.html).
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Perform this step before you install <%= vars.product_short %>.
    After you install <%= vars.product_short %>, you must complete the load balancer configuration.
    To complete the load balancer configuration,
    do the procedure in [Create a Network Tag for the Firewall Rule](./gcp-api-load-balancer.html#tag).</p>

##<a id='resources'></a> Resource Requirements

Installing Ops Manager and <%= vars.product_short %> requires the following virtual machines (VMs):

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>VM</th>
    <th>CPU</th>
    <th>Memory (GB)</th>
    <th>Ephemeral Disk (GB)</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>BOSH Director</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>8</td>
    <td>16</td>
  </tr>  
  <tr>
    <td>Ops Manager</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>8</td>
    <td>160</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><%= vars.control_plane %></td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>8</td>
    <td>64</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><%= vars.control_plane_db %></td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>8</td>
    <td>64</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class="note"><strong>NOTE:</strong> VMware recommends deploying TKGI on its own dedicated Ops Manager instance, rather than on a shared Ops Manager that also hosts other runtimes such as Tanzu Application Service.</p>

<h3> Kubernetes Cluster Resources </h3>

Each Kubernetes cluster provisioned through <%= vars.product_short %> deploys the VMs listed below.

If you deploy more than one Kubernetes cluster, you must scale your allocated resources appropriately.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>VM</th>
    <th>VM&nbsp;Count</th>
    <th>CPU Cores</th>
    <th>Memory (GB)</th>
    <th>Ephemeral Disk (GB)</th>
    <th>Persistent Disk (GB)</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Control Plane</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>32</td>
    <td>5</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Worker</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>32</td>
    <td>50</td>
  </tr>
</table>
