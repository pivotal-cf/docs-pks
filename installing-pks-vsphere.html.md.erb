This topic describes how to install and configure Pivotal Container Service (PKS) on vSphere.

##<a id='prerequisites'></a>Prerequisites

Before performing the procedures in this topic, you must have deployed and configured Ops Manager.
For more information, see [vSphere Prerequisites and Resource Requirements](vsphere-requirements.html).

##<a id='install'></a> Step 1: Install PKS

<%= partial 'install-pks' %>

##<a id='configure'></a> Step 2: Configure PKS

Click the orange **Pivotal Container Service** tile to start the configuration process.

To configure networking, do the following:

1. Click **Networking**.
1. Under **Container Networking Interface**, select **Flannel**.

1. (Optional) Configure a global proxy for all outgoing HTTP and HTTPS traffic from your Kubernetes clusters. 
<br><br>
Production environments can deny direct access to public Internet services and between internal services by placing an HTTP or HTTPS proxy in the network path between Kubernetes nodes and those services.
<br><br>
If your environment includes HTTP or HTTPS proxies, configuring PKS to use these proxies allows PKS-deployed Kubernetes nodes to access public Internet services and other internal services. Follow the steps below to configure a global proxy for all outgoing HTTP/HTTPS traffic from your Kubernetes clusters:
  1. Under **HTTP/HTTPS proxy**, select **Enabled**.
      <img src="images/networking-https-proxy.png" alt="Networking pane configuration" width="325">
  1. Under **HTTP Proxy URL**, enter the URL of your HTTP/HTTPS proxy endpoint. For example, `http://myproxy.com:1234`.
  1. (Optional) If your proxy uses basic authentication, enter the username and password under **HTTP Proxy Credentials**.
  1. Under **No Proxy**, enter the service network CIDR where your PKS cluster is deployed. List any additional IP addresses that should bypass the proxy.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: By default, the <code>.internal</code>, <code>10.100.0.0/8</code>, and <code>10.200.0.0/8</code> IP address ranges are not proxied. This allows internal PKS communication.</p>
1. Under **Allow outbound internet access from Kubernetes cluster vms (IaaS-dependent)**, ignore the **Enable outbound internet access** checkbox.
1. Click **Save**.

###<a id='errands'></a> Errands

Errands are scripts that run at designated points during an installation.

To configure when post-deploy and pre-delete errands for PKS are run, make a selection in the dropdown next to the errand. For a typical PKS deployment, we recommend that you leave the default settings.

For more information about errands and their configuration state, see [Managing Errands in Ops Manager](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/managing_errands.html).

<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING</strong>: Because PKS uses floating stemcells, updating the PKS tile with a new stemcell triggers the rolling of every VM in each cluster. Also, updating other product tiles in your deployment with a new stemcell causes the PKS tile to roll VMs. This rolling is enabled by the <strong>Upgrade all clusters errand</strong>. We recommend that you keep this errand turned on because automatic rolling of VMs ensures that all deployed cluster VMs are patched. However, automatic rolling can cause downtime in your deployment.
<br><br>
If you upgrade PKS from 1.0.x to 1.1, you must enable the <strong>Upgrade All Cluster</strong> errand. This ensures existing clusters can perform resize or delete actions after the upgrade.</p>

###<a id='resource-config'></a> Resource Config

To modify the resource usage of PKS, click **Resource Config** and edit the **Pivotal Container Service** job.

![Resource pane configuration](images/resources.png)

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you experience timeouts or slowness when interacting with the PKS API, select a <strong>VM Type</strong> with greater CPU and memory resources for the <strong>Pivotal Container Service</strong> job.</p>

## <a id='apply-changes'></a> Step 3: Apply Changes

After configuring the tile, return to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Apply Changes** to deploy the tile.

##<a id='retrieve-pks-api'></a> Step 4: Retrieve PKS API Endpoint

<%= partial 'share-endpoint' %>

## <a id='loadbalancer-pks-api'></a> Step 5: Configure External Load Balancer

After you install the PKS tile, configure an external load balancer to access the PKS API from outside the network.
You can use any external load balancer.

Your external load balancer forwards traffic to the PKS API endpoint on ports 8443 and 9021.
Configure the external load balancer to resolve to the domain name you set in the [PKS API](#pks-api) section of the tile configuration.

Configure your load balancer with the following information:

- IP address from [Retrieve PKS API Endpoint](#retrieve-pks-api)
- Ports 8443 and 9021
- HTTPS or TCP protocol

##<a id='next-steps'></a> Next Steps

After installing PKS on vSphere, you may want to do one or more of the following:

* [Install the PKS and Kubernetes CLIs](#clis)
* [Configure Authentication for PKS](#auth)
* [Integrate VMware Harbor with PKS](#harbor)

### <a name='clis'></a> Install the PKS and Kubernetes CLIs

<%= partial 'install-cli' %>

### <a name='auth'></a> Configure Authentication for PKS

<%= partial 'configure-auth' %>

### <a name='harbor'></a> Integrate VMware Harbor with PKS

<%= partial 'harbor' %>
