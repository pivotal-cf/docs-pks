### <a id="stage-tkgi"></a> Download and Import <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.13

When you upgrade <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>,
your configuration settings typically migrate to the new version automatically.
To download and import a <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> version:

1. Download the target version of the product
from [<%= vars.product_network %>](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-container-service/).

1. Import the target version of the TKGI tile to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard.
  <img src="images/nsxt/nsxt-30/upgrade-05.png">

1. Click **Review Pending Changes**.

1. Expand the **Errands** dropdown and enable or disable **Upgrade all clusters errand**
  - See [Deciding Between Full and Two-Phase Upgrade](./understanding-upgrades.html#decide) to decide whether to upgrade <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>-provisioned Kubernetes clusters along with <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>, or upgrade them later.
  - <%= vars.recommended_by %> recommends that you upgrade Kubernetes clusters along with <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> if possible.
  - Enable the **Upgrade all clusters errand** to upgrade clusters along with <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>.
  <p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> Disabling the <strong>Upgrade all clusters errand</strong>
  causes the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> version tagged in your Kubernetes clusters to fall behind
  the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr
 %> tile version.
  If you disable the <strong>Upgrade all clusters errand</strong>
  when upgrading the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr
 %> tile,
  you must upgrade all your Kubernetes clusters before the next <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>
  upgrade.</p>

1. Set the **Run smoke tests** errand to **On**.
The errand uses the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> CLI to create a Kubernetes cluster and then delete it.
If the creation or deletion fails, the errand fails and the installation of the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr
 %> tile is aborted.

### <a id="stemcell"></a>Download and Import Stemcells

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> requires a Xenial stemcell.
A stemcell for Windows 2019 is also required if you intend to create Windows worker-based clusters.
For information about Windows stemcells, see
[Configuring Windows Worker-Based Clusters](windows-workers.html).

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> If you use an automated pipeline to upgrade <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>, 
see <a href="upgrade-pipeline.html#configure-pipeline">Configure Automated Ops Manager and Xenial Stemcell Downloading</a> 
in <em>Configuring the Upgrade Pipeline</em>.  
</p> 

If Ops Manager does not have the Xenial stemcell required for <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.13,
the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr
 %> tile displays the message **Missing stemcell**.
To download and import a new Xenial stemcell, follow the steps below:

1. On the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr
 %> tile, click the **Missing stemcell** link.

    <img src="images/missing_stemcell.png" alt="Verify stemcell assignment">

1. In the **Stemcell Library**, locate the **<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr
 %>** tile and note the required stemcell version.

1. Navigate to the [Stemcells (Ubuntu Xenial)](https://network.pivotal.io/products/stemcells-ubuntu-xenial/) page on <%= vars.product_network %>
and download the required stemcell version for your IaaS.

1. Return to the **Installation Dashboard** in Ops Manager and click **Stemcell Library**.

1. On the **Stemcell Library** page, click **Import Stemcell** and select the stemcell file you downloaded from <%= vars.product_network %>.

1. Select the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr
 %> tile and click **Apply Stemcell to Products**.

1. Verify that Ops Manager successfully applied the stemcell. The stemcell version you imported and applied appears in the **Staged** column for <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr
 %>.

1. Return to the **Installation Dashboard**.

### <a id="upgrade-tkgi"></a>Upgrade the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Tile

To complete the upgrade of the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr
 %> tile:

1. Return to the **Installation Dashboard** in Ops Manager.

1. Click **Review Pending Changes**.
     For more information about this Ops Manager page, see
    [Reviewing Pending Product Changes](https://docs.pivotal.io/ops-manager/install/review-pending-changes.html).

1. Click **Apply Changes.**
  <img src="images/nsxt/nsxt-30/upgrade-06.png">

1. (Optional) If you enabled the **Upgrade all clusters errand**, you can use the BOSH CLI to monitor its progress:
      1. Log in to the BOSH Director by running `bosh -e MY-ENVIRONMENT log-in` from a VM that can access your <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> deployment. For more information, see [Using BOSH Diagnostic Commands in <%= vars.product_short %>](diagnostic-tools.html).
      1. Run `bosh -e MY-ENVIRONMENT tasks`.
      1. Locate the task number for the errand in the <strong>&#35;</strong> column of the BOSH output.
      1. Run `bosh task TASK-NUMBER`, replacing `TASK-NUMBER` with the task number you located in the previous step.

1. Verify that the TKGI tile shows the target version.
  <img src="images/nsxt/nsxt-30/upgrade-07.png">

## <a id="after-upgrade"></a>After the Upgrade

After you complete the upgrade to <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.13,
complete the following verifications and upgrades:

1. [Upgrade the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> and Kubernetes CLIs](#upgrade-clis)
1. [Upgrade Kubernetes Clusters if Needed](#upgrade-k8s)
1. [Verify <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Upgrade](#verify-upgrade)
1. [Upgrade NSX-T Data Center to v3.1](#upgrade-nsxt)
1. [(Optional) Upgrade to vSphere 7](#upgrade-vsphere)

### <a id="upgrade-clis"></a>Upgrade the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> and Kubernetes CLIs

Upgrade the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> and Kubernetes CLIs on any local machine
where you run commands that interact with your upgraded version of <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>.

To upgrade the CLIs, download and re-install the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> and Kubernetes CLI distributions
that are provided with <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> on <%= vars.product_network %>.

For more information about installing the CLIs, see the following topics:

* [Installing the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> CLI](installing-cli.html)

* [Installing the Kubernetes CLI](installing-kubectl-cli.html)

###<a id='upgrade-k8s'></a>Upgrade Kubernetes Clusters If Needed

If you upgraded <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> with the **Upgrade all clusters errand** disabled,
the next step is to upgrade the Kubernetes clusters individually using the TKGI CLI.

1. Log in to the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> environment using the [TKGI CLI](./cli/index.html).

1. Run the command `tkgi clusters` to list all Kubernetes clusters with their current versions and status:

    ```
    TKGI Version     Name              k8s Version  Plan Name  UUID                                  Status     Action
    1.12.0  tkgi-cluster-1-small       1.21.3       small      0bea03c8-af47-48e8-b249-814c0bc407b9  succeeded  CREATE
    1.12.0  tkgi-cluster-2-medium      1.21.3       medium     5d9f4501-70cb-460b-9d78-0afbc074cb8c  succeeded  CREATE
    1.12.0  tkgi-cluster-3-large       1.21.3       large      b448117a-bb6f-49de-bc9b-452588bd44ef  succeeded  CREATE
    ```

1. Upgrade each cluster one-by-one using the command `tkgi upgrade-cluster CLUSTER-NAME`.
  - You do not have to wait for each upgrade to complete before upgrading the next one.
  - The advantage of running each upgrade separately is that it makes troubleshooting easier.
  BOSH assigns a unique task ID to each cluster upgrade.

1. When the cluster upgrades are complete, run the command `tkgi clusters` and verify that they list the target version:

    ```
    TKGI Version     Name              k8s Version  Plan Name  UUID                                  Status     Action
    1.13.0  tkgi-cluster-1-small       1.22.2       small      0bea03c8-af47-48e8-b249-814c0bc407b9  succeeded  UPGRADE
    1.13.0  tkgi-cluster-2-medium      1.22.2       medium     5d9f4501-70cb-460b-9d78-0afbc074cb8c  succeeded  UPGRADE
    1.13.0  tkgi-cluster-3-large       1.22.2       large      b448117a-bb6f-49de-bc9b-452588bd44ef  succeeded  UPGRADE
    ```

###<a id='verify'></a>Verify <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Upgrade

1. To verify successful upgrade, create a test cluster:

    ```
    tkgi create-cluster tkgi-cluster-4-test --external-hostname tkgi-cluster-test --plan medium --num-nodes 3
    ```
    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Use only lowercase characters when naming your cluster 
    if you manage your clusters with Tanzu Mission Control (TMC). Clusters with names that include an uppercase character cannot be attached to TMC.
    </p>
1. Run `tkgi clusters` to verify that the new cluster is created with the appropriate version of TKGI and Kubernetes:

    ```
    $ tkgi clusters
    TKGI Version     Name              k8s Version  Plan Name  UUID                                  Status     Action
    1.13.0  tkgi-cluster-4-test        1.22.2       medium     5d9f4501-70cb-460b-9d78-0afbc074cb8c  succeeded  CREATE
    1.13.0  tkgi-cluster-1-small       1.22.2       small      0bea03c8-af47-48e8-b249-814c0bc407b9  succeeded  UPGRADE
    1.13.0  tkgi-cluster-2-medium      1.22.2       medium     5d9f4501-70cb-460b-9d78-0afbc074cb8c  succeeded  UPGRADE
    1.13.0  tkgi-cluster-3-large       1.22.2       large      b448117a-bb6f-49de-bc9b-452588bd44ef  succeeded  UPGRADE
    ```

##<a id='upgrade-vsphere'></a> Upgrade to vSphere 7

After upgrading <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> and its Kubernetes clusters to v1.13, you can upgrade vSphere to v7.
This upgrade includes upgrading the vCenter Server Appliance and each ESXi host, in that order.

1. Upgrade vCenter. Refer to [Upgrading the vCenter Server Appliance](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/com.vmware.vcenter.upgrade.doc/GUID-30485437-B107-42EC-A0A8-A03334CFC825.html) in the vCenter documentation.
1. Upgrade each ESXi host, one at a time.
  1. Put the ESXi host into maintenance mode.
  1. Upgrade the ESXi host. Refer to [Upgrading ESXi hosts](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/com.vmware.esxi.upgrade.doc/GUID-122035F6-8433-463E-A0F7-B4FC71A05B04.html) in the vSphere documentation.
  1. Using the NSX-T Manager web interface for Transport Nodes, install the vSphere 7.0 VIBS onto the ESXi host.
  1. Using the NSX Manage web interface, verify that the ESXi host is in a "Success" state. If it is not, click the **Resolve** button.
  1. Remove the ESXi host from maintenance mode.
  1. Repeat the process for each ESXi host in your vCenter cluster that is part of your TKGI domain.
