This topic explains how to upgrade <%= vars.product_short %> (<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>)
from v1.7 to v1.8
on vSphere with NSX-T networking.

For instructions on upgrading <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>
with Flannel networking,
see [Upgrading <%= vars.product_short %> (Flannel Networking)](upgrade.html).

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> Do not manually upgrade your Kubernetes version.
<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> includes the compatible Kubernetes version.
</p>

## <a id="overview"></a>Overview

Before you upgrade, follow the procedures in [Prepare to Upgrade](#prepare) below
to plan and prepare your upgrade.

After you complete the preparation steps,
continue to the procedures in [Perform the Upgrade](#upgrade) below.
These steps guide you through the process of upgrading Ops Manager and the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr
 %> tile,
importing an updated stemcell, and applying the changes to your deployment.

After you complete the upgrade, follow the procedures
in [After the Upgrade](#after-upgrade) below
to verify that your upgraded <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> deployment is running properly
and to optionally upgrade NSX-T and vSphere.

## <a id="prerequisites"></a>Prerequisites

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.8 does not support NSX-T v2.4. You must upgrade
to NSX-T v2.5 before upgrading to <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.8.

To see a list of NSX-T 2.5 versions compatible with <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.8,
consult [Product Snapshot](release-notes.html) in _Release Notes_ for <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.8.

## <a id="prepare"></a>Prepare to Upgrade

If you have not already, complete all of the steps in
[Upgrade Preparation Checklist for <%= vars.product_short %> v1.8](checklist.html).

## <a id="upgrade"></a>Perform the Upgrade

This section describes the steps required to upgrade to <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.8:

1. [Upgrade Ops Manager](#upgrade-opsman)
1. [Download and Import <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.8](#stage-tkgi)
1. [Download and Import the Stemcell if Needed](#stemcell)
1. [Upgrade the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Tile](#upgrade-tkgi)

### <a id="upgrade-opsman"></a>Upgrade Ops Manager

Each version of <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> is compatible with multiple versions of Ops Manager.
See [<%= vars.product_network %>](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-container-service)
to determine if your Ops Manager version is compatible with <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.8.

To upgrade Ops Manager from v2.8.5 or later to v2.9.3 or later:

1. Log in to Ops Manager.

1. Click your username in the top right corner and navigate to **Settings** > **Export Installation Settings**.

1. Click **Export Installation Settings**. 
  - Ops Manager exports an encrypted archive of your current installation configuration. 
  - Later, you import this configuration into to your upgraded Ops Manager.
  <img src="images/nsxt/nsxt-30/upgrade-01.png">

1. Log in to vCenter Server using the vSphere Client.

1. Shut down the Ops Manager VM.

1. Deploy the upgraded Ops Manager VM by following the first two steps of [Deploying Ops Manager with NSX-T for <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>](vsphere-nsxt-om-deploy.html):
  1. [Step 1: Generate SSH Key Pair](vsphere-nsxt-om-deploy.html#ssh-key)
  1. [Step 2: Deploy Ops Manager for <%= vars.product_short %>](vsphere-nsxt-om-deploy.html#deploy-om)

1. Using a browser, navigate to the newly-deployed Ops Manager web interface.

1. On the welcome page, select **Import Existing Installation**.
  <img src="images/nsxt/nsxt-30/upgrade-02.png">

1. Browse to and select the installation configuration archive you exported.

1. Log in to Ops Manager 

1. Click **Apply Changes**. 
  <img src="images/nsxt/nsxt-30/upgrade-03.png">

1. Verify that the BOSH Director for vSphere tile shows the target, updated version.
  <img src="images/nsxt/nsxt-30/upgrade-04.png">

### <a id="stage-tkgi"></a> Download and Import <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.8

When you upgrade <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>,
your configuration settings typically migrate to the new version automatically.
To download and import a <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> version:

1. Download the target version of the product
from [<%= vars.product_network %>](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-container-service/).

1. Import the target version of the TKGI tile to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard. 
  <img src="images/nsxt/nsxt-30/upgrade-05.png">

1. Click **Review Pending Changes**.

1. Expand the **Errands** dropdown and enable or disable **Upgrade all clusters errand**
  - See [Deciding Between Full and Two-Phase Upgrade](./understanding-upgrades.html#decide) to decide whether to upgrade <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>-provisioned Kubernetes clusters along with <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>, or upgrade them later.
  - <%= vars.recommended_by %> recommends that you upgrade Kubernetes clusters along with <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> if possible.
  - Enable the **Upgrade all clusters errand** to upgrade clusters along with <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>.
  <p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> Disabling the <strong>Upgrade all clusters errand</strong>
  causes the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> version tagged in your Kubernetes clusters to fall behind
  the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr
 %> tile version.
  If you disable the <strong>Upgrade all clusters errand</strong>
  when upgrading the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr
 %> tile,
  you must upgrade all your Kubernetes clusters before the next <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>
  upgrade.</p>
  <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If you are upgrading <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> on NSX-T v2.5,
  you must select the **Upgrade all clusters errand** or plan to upgrade all clusters individually before
  upgrading to NSX-T v3.0.
  </p>

1. Set the **Run smoke tests** errand to **On**.
The errand uses the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> CLI to create a Kubernetes cluster and then delete it.
If the creation or deletion fails, the errand fails and the installation of the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr
 %> tile is aborted.
          
### <a id="stemcell"></a>Download and Import the Stemcell if Needed

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> requires a Xenial stemcell.

<p class="note warning">Because <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.8.0 is incompatible with 621.76+ stemcells, you must upgrade <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> to v1.8.1 and update all clusters before upgrading stemcells to 621.76+.</p>

If Ops Manager does not have the Xenial stemcell required for <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.8,
the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr
 %> tile displays the message **Missing stemcell**.
To download and import a new Xenial stemcell, follow the steps below:

1. On the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr
 %> tile, click the **Missing stemcell** link.

    <img src="images/missing_stemcell.png" alt="Verify stemcell assignment">

1. In the **Stemcell Library**, locate the **<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr
 %>** tile and note the required stemcell version.

1. Navigate to the [Stemcells (Ubuntu Xenial)](https://network.pivotal.io/products/stemcells-ubuntu-xenial/) page on <%= vars.product_network %>
and download the required stemcell version for your IaaS.

1. Return to the **Installation Dashboard** in Ops Manager and click **Stemcell Library**.

1. On the **Stemcell Library** page, click **Import Stemcell** and select the stemcell file you downloaded from <%= vars.product_network %>.

1. Select the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr
 %> tile and click **Apply Stemcell to Products**.

1. Verify that Ops Manager successfully applied the stemcell. The stemcell version you imported and applied appears in the **Staged** column for <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr
 %>.

1. Return to the **Installation Dashboard**.

### <a id="upgrade-tkgi"></a>Upgrade the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Tile

To complete the upgrade of the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr
 %> tile:

1. Return to the **Installation Dashboard** in Ops Manager.

1. Click **Review Pending Changes**.
     For more information about this Ops Manager page, see
    [Reviewing Pending Product Changes](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/2-7/customizing/review-pending-changes.html).

1. Click **Apply Changes.**
  <img src="images/nsxt/nsxt-30/upgrade-06.png">

1. (Optional) If you enabled the **Upgrade all clusters errand**, you can use the BOSH CLI to monitor its progress:
      1. Log in to the BOSH Director by running `bosh -e MY-ENVIRONMENT log-in` from a VM that can access your <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> deployment. For more information, see [Using BOSH Diagnostic Commands in <%= vars.product_short %>](diagnostic-tools.html).
      1. Run `bosh -e MY-ENVIRONMENT tasks`.
      1. Locate the task number for the errand in the <strong>&#35;</strong> column of the BOSH output.
      1. Run `bosh task TASK-NUMBER`, replacing `TASK-NUMBER` with the task number you located in the previous step.

1. Verify that the TKGI tile is updated to the target version.
  <img src="images/nsxt/nsxt-30/upgrade-07.png">

## <a id="after-upgrade"></a>After the Upgrade

After you complete the upgrade to <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.8,
complete the following verifications and upgrades:

- [Update the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> and Kubernetes CLIs](#update-clis)
- [Upgrade Kubernetes Clusters if Needed](#upgrade-k8s)
- [Verify <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Upgrade](#verify-upgrade)
- [(Optional) Upgrade NSX-T Data Center v2.5 to v3.0](#upgrade-nsxt)
- [(Optional) Upgrade to vSphere 7](#upgrade-vsphere)

### <a id="update-clis"></a>Update the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> and Kubernetes CLIs

Update the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> and Kubernetes CLIs on any local machine
where you run commands that interact with your upgraded version of <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>.

To update your CLIs, download and re-install the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> and Kubernetes CLI distributions
that are provided with <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> on <%= vars.product_network %>.

For more information about installing the CLIs, see the following topics:

* [Installing the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> CLI](installing-cli.html)

* [Installing the Kubernetes CLI](installing-kubectl-cli.html)

###<a id='upgrade-k8s'></a>Upgrade Kubernetes Clusters if Needed

If you upgraded <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> with the **Upgrade all clusters errand** disabled,
the next step is to upgrade the Kubernetes clusters individually using the TKGI CLI.

1. Log in to the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> environment using the [TKGI CLI](./cli/index.html). 

1. Run the command `tkgi clusters` to list all Kubernetes clusters with their current versions and status:

    ```
    PKS Version     Name                      k8s Version  Plan Name  UUID                                  Status     Action
    1.7.0  pks-cluster-1-small  		1.16.7       small      0bea03c8-af47-48e8-b249-814c0bc407b9  succeeded  CREATE
    1.7.0  pks-cluster-2-medium      1.16.7       medium     5d9f4501-70cb-460b-9d78-0afbc074cb8c  succeeded  CREATE
    1.7.0  pks-cluster-3-large       1.16.7       large      b448117a-bb6f-49de-bc9b-452588bd44ef  succeeded  CREATE
    ```

1. Update each cluster one-by-one using the command `tkgi upgrade-cluster CLUSTER-NAME`.
  - You do not have to wait for each upgrade to complete before upgrading the next one.
  - The advantage of running each upgrade separately is that it makes troubleshooting easier.
  BOSH assigns a unique task ID to each cluster upgrade.

1. When the cluster upgrades are complete, run the command `tkgi clusters` and verify that they list the target version:

    ```
    PKS Version     Name                      k8s Version  Plan Name  UUID                                  Status     Action
    1.8.0  pks-cluster-1-small  		1.17.5       small      0bea03c8-af47-48e8-b249-814c0bc407b9  succeeded  UPGRADE
    1.8.0  pks-cluster-2-medium      1.17.5       medium     5d9f4501-70cb-460b-9d78-0afbc074cb8c  succeeded  UPGRADE
    1.8.0  pks-cluster-3-large       1.17.5       large      b448117a-bb6f-49de-bc9b-452588bd44ef  succeeded  UPGRADE
    ```

###<a id='verify'></a>Verify <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Upgrade

1. To verify successful upgrade, create a test cluster: 

    ```
    pks create-cluster pks-cluster-4-test --external-hostname pks-cluster-test --plan medium --num-nodes 3
    ```

1. Run `tkgi clusters` to verify that the new cluster is created with the appropriate version of TKGI and Kubernetes:

    ```
    $ tkgi clusters
    PKS Version     Name                      k8s Version  Plan Name  UUID                                  Status     Action
    1.8.0  pks-cluster-4-test        1.17.5       medium     5d9f4501-70cb-460b-9d78-0afbc074cb8c  succeeded  CREATE
    1.8.0  pks-cluster-1-small       1.17.5       small      0bea03c8-af47-48e8-b249-814c0bc407b9  succeeded  UPGRADE
    1.8.0  pks-cluster-2-medium      1.17.5       medium     5d9f4501-70cb-460b-9d78-0afbc074cb8c  succeeded  UPGRADE
    1.8.0  pks-cluster-3-large       1.17.5       large      b448117a-bb6f-49de-bc9b-452588bd44ef  succeeded  UPGRADE
    ```

## <a id="upgrade-nsxt"></a>Upgrade NSX-T Data Center v2.5 to v3.0

  <p class="note warning">
  <strong>Warning:</strong> Refer to the <a href="release-notes.html">Release Notes</a> for current version support, known issues, and other important information.</p>
