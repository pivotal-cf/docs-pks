1. Click **Review Pending Changes**.

1. Expand the **Errands** dropdown and activate or deactivate **Upgrade all clusters errand**
  - See [Deciding Between Full and Two-Phase Upgrade](./understanding-upgrades.html#decide) to decide whether to upgrade TKGI-provisioned Kubernetes clusters along with TKGI, or upgrade them later.
  - <%= vars.recommended_by %> recommends that you upgrade Kubernetes clusters along with TKGI if possible.
  - Activate the **Upgrade all clusters errand** to upgrade clusters along with TKGI.
  <p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> Deactivating the <strong>Upgrade all clusters errand</strong>
  causes the TKGI version tagged in your Kubernetes clusters to fall behind
  the TKGI tile version.
  If you deactivate the <strong>Upgrade all clusters errand</strong>
  when upgrading the TKGI tile,
  you must upgrade all your Kubernetes clusters before the next TKGI
  upgrade.</p>

1. Set the **Run smoke tests** errand to **On**. 
The Smoke Test errand smoke tests the TKGI upgrade 
by creating and deleting a test Kubernetes cluster. 
For more information, see [Errands](installing-nsx-t.html#errands) 
in _Installing Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition on vSphere with VMware NSX_.   

1. (Optional) Configure the Smoke Test errand to use a network profile instead of the default configuration settings on the TKGI tile. 
For more information, see [Errands](installing-nsx-t.html#errands) 
in _Installing Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition on vSphere with VMware NSX_.  

### <a id="stemcell"></a>Download and Import Stemcells

TKGI requires an Ubuntu Jammy Stemcell for VMware Tanzu.
A Windows 2019 Windows Stemcell for VMware Tanzu is also required if you intend to create Windows worker-based clusters.
For information about Windows stemcells, see
[Configuring Windows Worker-Based Clusters](windows-workers.html).

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> If you use an automated pipeline to upgrade TKGI, 
see <a href="upgrade-pipeline.html#configure-pipeline">Configure Automated Ops Manager and Ubuntu Jammy Stemcell for Tanzu Downloading</a> 
in <em>Configuring the Upgrade Pipeline</em>.  
</p> 

If Ops Manager does not have the Ubuntu Jammy Stemcell for VMware Tanzu required for TKGI <%= vars.product_version %>,
the TKGI tile displays the message **Missing stemcell**.
To download and import a new Ubuntu Jammy Stemcell for VMware Tanzu, follow the steps below:

1. On the TKGI tile, click the **Missing stemcell** link.

    <img src="images/missing_stemcell.png" alt="Verify stemcell assignment">

1. Click **Apply Changes.**
  <img src="images/nsxt/nsxt-30/upgrade-06.png" alt="The Ops Manager Review Pending Changes page, with options to select which product updates to apply, and the Apply Changes button.">

1. (Optional) If you activated the **Upgrade all clusters errand**, you can use the BOSH CLI to monitor its progress:
      1. Log in to the BOSH Director by running `bosh -e MY-ENVIRONMENT log-in` from a VM that can access your TKGI deployment. For more information, see [Using BOSH Diagnostic Commands in Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition](diagnostic-tools.html).
      1. Run `bosh -e MY-ENVIRONMENT tasks`.
      1. Locate the task number for the errand in the <strong>&#35;</strong> column of the BOSH output.
      1. Run `bosh task TASK-NUMBER`, replacing `TASK-NUMBER` with the task number you located in the previous step.

1. Verify that the TKGI tile shows the target version.
  <img src="images/nsxt/nsxt-30/upgrade-07.png"  alt="The Ops Manager Installation Dashboard page after upgrading the TKGI tile.">

## <a id="after-upgrade"></a>After the Upgrade

After you complete the upgrade to TKGI <%= vars.product_version %>,
complete the following verifications and upgrades:

1. [Upgrade the TKGI and Kubernetes CLIs](#upgrade-clis)
1. [Upgrade Kubernetes Clusters if Needed](#upgrade-k8s)
1. [Verify TKGI Upgrade](#verify-upgrade)
1. [Upgrade NSX Data Center to NSX v3.2.3 or Later](#upgrade-nsxt)
1. [(Optional) Upgrade to vSphere 8](#upgrade-vsphere)


### <a id="upgrade-clis"></a>Upgrade the TKGI and Kubernetes CLIs

Upgrade the TKGI and Kubernetes CLIs on any local machine
where you run commands that interact with your upgraded version of TKGI.

To upgrade the CLIs, download and re-install the TKGI and Kubernetes CLI distributions
that are provided with TKGI on <%= vars.product_network %>.

For more information about installing the CLIs, see the following topics:

* [Installing the TKGI CLI](installing-cli.html)

* [Installing the Kubernetes CLI](installing-kubectl-cli.html)

###<a id='upgrade-k8s'></a>Upgrade Kubernetes Clusters If Needed

If you upgraded TKGI with the **Upgrade all clusters errand** deactivated,
the next step is to upgrade the Kubernetes clusters individually using the TKGI CLI.

1. Log in to the TKGI environment using the [TKGI CLI](./cli/index.html).

1. Run the command `tkgi clusters` to list all Kubernetes clusters with their current versions and status:

    ```
    TKGI Version     Name              k8s Version  Plan Name  UUID                                
    1.18.4  tkgi-cluster-1-small       1.27.13      small      0bea03c8-af47-48e8-b249-814c0bc407b9
    1.18.4  tkgi-cluster-2-medium      1.27.13      medium     5d9f4501-70cb-460b-9d78-0afbc074cb8c
    1.18.4  tkgi-cluster-3-large       1.27.13      large      b448117a-bb6f-49de-bc9b-452588bd44ef
    ```

1. Upgrade each cluster one-by-one using the command `tkgi upgrade-cluster CLUSTER-NAME`.
  - You do not have to wait for each upgrade to complete before upgrading the next one.
  - The advantage of running each upgrade separately is that it makes troubleshooting easier.
  BOSH assigns a unique task ID to each cluster upgrade.

1. When the cluster upgrades are complete, run the command `tkgi clusters` and verify that they list the target version:

    ```
    TKGI Version     Name              k8s Version  Plan Name  UUID                                  Status     Action
    1.20.0  tkgi-cluster-1-small       1.29.6       small      0bea03c8-af47-48e8-b249-814c0bc407b9  succeeded  UPGRADE
    1.20.0  tkgi-cluster-2-medium      1.29.6       medium     5d9f4501-70cb-460b-9d78-0afbc074cb8c  succeeded  UPGRADE
    1.20.0  tkgi-cluster-3-large       1.29.6       large      b448117a-bb6f-49de-bc9b-452588bd44ef  succeeded  UPGRADE
    ```

###<a id='verify'></a>Verify TKGI Upgrade

1. To verify successful upgrade, create a test cluster:

    ```
    tkgi create-cluster tkgi-cluster-4-test --external-hostname tkgi-cluster-test --plan medium --num-nodes 3
    ```
    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Use only lowercase characters when naming your cluster 
    if you manage your clusters with Tanzu Mission Control (TMC). Clusters with names that include an uppercase character cannot be attached to TMC.
    </p>
1. Run `tkgi clusters` to verify that the new cluster is created with the appropriate version of TKGI and Kubernetes:

    ```
    $ tkgi clusters
    TKGI Version     Name              k8s Version  Plan Name  UUID                                  Status     Action
    1.20.0  tkgi-cluster-4-test        1.29.6       medium     5d9f4501-70cb-460b-9d78-0afbc074cb8c  succeeded  CREATE
    1.20.0  tkgi-cluster-1-small       1.29.6       small      0bea03c8-af47-48e8-b249-814c0bc407b9  succeeded  UPGRADE
    1.20.0  tkgi-cluster-2-medium      1.29.6       medium     5d9f4501-70cb-460b-9d78-0afbc074cb8c  succeeded  UPGRADE
    1.20.0  tkgi-cluster-3-large       1.29.6       large      b448117a-bb6f-49de-bc9b-452588bd44ef  succeeded  UPGRADE
    ```


##<a id='upgrade-vsphere'></a> (Optional) Upgrade to vSphere 8

After upgrading TKGI and its Kubernetes clusters to <%= vars.product_version %>, you can upgrade vSphere to v8.
This upgrade includes upgrading the vCenter Server Appliance and each ESXi host, in that order.

1. Upgrade vCenter. Refer to [Upgrading the vCenter Server Appliance](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/8.0/vsphere-vcenter-upgrade/GUID-30485437-B107-42EC-A0A8-A03334CFC825.html) in the vCenter documentation.
1. Upgrade each ESXi host, one at a time.
  1. Put the ESXi host into maintenance mode.
  1. Upgrade the ESXi host. Refer to [Upgrading ESXi hosts](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/8.0/vsphere-esxi-upgrade/GUID-122035F6-8433-463E-A0F7-B4FC71A05B04.html) in the vSphere documentation.
  1. Using the NSX Manager web interface for Transport Nodes, install the vSphere 8.0 VIBS onto the ESXi host.
  1. Using the NSX Manage web interface, verify that the ESXi host is in a "Success" state. If it is not, click the **Resolve** button.
  1. Remove the ESXi host from maintenance mode.
  1. Repeat the process for each ESXi host in your vCenter cluster that is part of your TKGI domain.
