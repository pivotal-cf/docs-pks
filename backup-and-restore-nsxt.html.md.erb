This topic describes how to back up and restore NSX-T Data Center for TKGI.

## NSX-T Data Center Backup and Recover

NSX-T Data Center provides in-product backup and recovery that supports backup and restore of the NSX Manager Nodes. For more information, see [Backing Up and Restoring NSX Manager](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center/3.0/administration/GUID-A0B3667C-FB7D-413F-816D-019BFAD81AC5.html?hWord=N4IghgNiBcIEZgMYGsCuAHABGAdgE0wCcBTAZwBcB7EkAXyA) in the NSX-T documentation.

## Deployment Assumptions

To backup and restore NSX-T Data Center, it is assumed that 3 NSX Manager Nodes are deployed, and there is an HA VIP configured for access to the NSX Management Plane. In addition, there are at least 2 Edge Nodes deployed with an HA VIP for the Edge Nodes.

For more information, refer the to the [NSX-T for TKGI installation instructions](./nsxt-3-0-install.html).

## Backup Procedure

Create a backup of the NSX-T Manager Nodes as follows:

1. Log in to the NSX Manager web console.

1. Navigate to **System > Backup & Restore**.

1. Select **Edit** and configure the backup location for the NSX Configuration. 
  For more information, refer to [Configure Backups](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center/3.0/administration/GUID-E6181BF1-2CB7-4870-B508-BFAF5B47D702.html)
  in the NSX-T Data Center documentation.

1. Click **Start Backup** to begin the backup of the NSX Manager database.

### Restore Procedure

To restore NSX-T Data Center, you restore the configuration using the backup and start sending traffic. See [Restore a Backup](
https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center/3.0/administration/GUID-9749F041-15E5-4662-85E7-756D4B071C17.html) in the NSX-T Data Center documentation.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Configuration changes made between backup and restore will not be saved.</p>

## Testing Procedure

The following test scenario assumes TKGI is installed on vSphere with NSX-T 3.0, and that a full backup of NSX-T Manager has been performed. This scenario tests the restoration of NSX-T.

1. Verify NSX-T connectivity by testing access to a deployed Kubernetes application that is fronted by a service of type LoadBalancer. This verifies that the NSX-T load balancer is functioning correctly.
1. Shut down all 3 NSX Manager VMs, and delete them.
1. Deploy a new NSX Manager node. For more information, refer to the [NSX-T for TKGI installation documentation](./nsxt-3-0-install.html).
1. Restore the NSX Manager configuration from the backup. See See [Restore a Backup](
https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center/3.0/administration/GUID-9749F041-15E5-4662-85E7-756D4B071C17.html) in the NSX-T documentation.
1. Add 2 additional Managers.
