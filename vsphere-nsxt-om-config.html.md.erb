1. Click **Save**.

    <%= image_tag("images/nsxt/bosh/config-bosh-05.png") %>

## <a id='dir-config'></a>Step 3: Configure BOSH Director

To configure BOSH Director settings:  

1. Select **Director Config** in  BOSH Director.

    <%= image_tag("images/nsxt/bosh/config-bosh-06.png") %>

1. In the **NTP Servers (comma delimited)** field, enter your NTP server addresses.

    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The NTP server configuration only updates
    after VM recreation. Ensure that you select the <strong>Recreate VMs deployed by the BOSH Director</strong> checkbox
    if you modify the value of this field.</p>

1. Leave the **JMX Provider IP Address** field blank.

1. Leave the **Bosh HM Forwarder IP Address** field blank.

1. Select the **Enable VM Resurrector Plugin** to enable BOSH Resurrector functionality.

1. Select **Enable Post Deploy Scripts** to run a post-deploy script after deployment. This script allows the job to execute additional commands against a deployment.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: You must enable post-deploy scripts to install <%= vars.product_short %>.</p>

1. Select **Recreate VMs deployed by the BOSH Director** to force BOSH to recreate all BOSH-managed VMs on the next deploy. This process does not destroy any persistent disk data.

1. For typical <%= vars.product_short %> deployments, the default settings for all other BOSH Director configuration parameters are suitable. Optionally you can apply additional configurations to BOSH Director. See [Director Config Pane](https://docs.pivotal.io/ops-manager/vsphere/config.html#dir-config) in <em>Configuring BOSH Director on vSphere</em> in the Ops Manager documentation for details.
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you need to be able to remotely access the BOSH Director VM using the BOSH CLI, and you are deploying <%= vars.product_short %> with NSX-T in a NAT topology, you must provide the <strong>Director Hostname</strong> for BOSH at the time of installation. See <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/ops-manager/vsphere/config.html#dir-config">Director Config Pane</a> in <em>Configuring BOSH Director on vSphere</em> in the Ops Manager documentation for details.</p>

1. Click **Save**.

    <%= image_tag("images/nsxt/bosh/config-bosh-07.png") %>

## <a id='create-az'></a>Step 4: Create Availability Zones

On vSphere with NSX-T, operators define and create Availability Zones (AZs) using vCenter clusters and resource pools.
Plans defined in the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> tile then use these AZs to enable high availability for <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> clusters.

The <%= vars.product_short %> control plane also runs in one of the AZs. 

For more information on AZs in <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>, see [Availability Zones](./control-plane.html#azs)
in _Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition Architecture_.

To configure Availability Zones:

1. Select **Create Availability Zones** in BOSH Director.

    <%= image_tag("images/nsxt/bosh/config-bosh-08.png") %>

1. Use the following steps to create one or more Availability Zones for <%= vars.product_short %> to use:
    1. Click **Add** and create the <%= vars.product_short %> Management AZ.
    1. Enter a unique **Name** for the Availability Zone, such as `AZ-MGMT`.
    1. Select the IaaS configuration (vSphere/vCenter).
    1. Enter the name of an existing vCenter **Cluster** to use as an Availability Zone, such as `COMP-Cluster-1`.
    1. Enter the name of the <%= vars.product_short %> Management **Resource Pool** in the vCenter cluster that you specified above, such as `RP-MGMT-TKGI`. The jobs running in this Availability Zone share the CPU and memory resources defined by the pool.
    1. Click **Add Cluster** and create at least one <%= vars.product_short %> Compute AZ.
    1. Specify the **Cluster** and the **Resource Pool**, such as `RP-TKGI-AZ`. 
    Alternatively, specify the **Cluster** and the **Host Group**. 
    See [Using vSphere Host Group](./vsphere-host-group.html) for more information.
    1. (Optional) If you are using a host group with vSAN stretched clusters,
        set the **VM-Host Affinity Rule** dropdown to `SHOULD`. This setting maintains high availability 
        by letting <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> restart VMs in another host group if their AZ fails. 
        <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> ignores this setting if the vSAN cluster has no host group configured.  
<br>
        For more information, see [Ability to Set the VM-Host Affinity Rule to "Should" for Clusters in vSphere]
        (https://docs.pivotal.io/ops-manager/2-9/release-notes.html#vm-affinity-rule) 
        in the _Ops Manager v2.9 Release Notes_.  
<br>
    1. Add additional clusters as necessary. Click the trash icon to delete a cluster. The first cluster cannot be deleted.

1. Click **Save**.

    <%= image_tag("images/nsxt/bosh/config-bosh-12.png") %>

## <a id='create-networks'></a>Step 5: Create Networks

You must configure and create BOSH Director networking.  

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you are using <a href="nsxt-topologies.html#topology-no-nat-virtual-switch">No-NAT with Virtual Switch (VSS/VDS) Topology</a>, 
    create the infrastructure network and optionally the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> network by 
    following the instructions in <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/ops-manager/vsphere/config.html#create-networks">Create Networks Pane</a> in 
    <i>Configuring BOSH Director on vSphere</i> in the Ops Manager documentation. 
    While completing the steps in <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/ops-manager/vsphere/config.html#create-networks">Create Networks Pane</a>,
    do not create the <code>services</code> network. With <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> on NSX-T, NSX-T manages the dynamically created networks.
</p>

To configure BOSH Director networking:  

1. Select **Create Networks** in BOSH Director.

    <%= image_tag("images/nsxt/bosh/config-bosh-15.png") %>

1. Select **Enable ICMP checks** to enable ICMP on your networks. Ops Manager uses ICMP checks to confirm that components within your network are reachable.

1. Click **Add Network**.

    <%= image_tag("images/nsxt/bosh/config-bosh-16.png") %>

1. Create the following network:
  * `NET-MGMT-TKGI`: Network for Ops Manager, BOSH Director, and <%= vars.product_short %> components. This network maps to the NSX logical switch created for the <%= vars.product_short %> Management Network. See [Create Management Plane](./nsxt-3-0-install.html#nsxt30-mgmt-plane) in _Installing and Configuring NSX-T Data Center v3.0 for <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>_.

      <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: NSX-T automatically creates the service network to be used by the master and worker nodes (VMs) for Kubernetes clusters managed by <%= vars.product_short %>. You should not manually create this network.</p>

    Use the following values as a guide when you define the network in BOSH. Replace the IP addresses with ranges you defined for the [Create Management Plane](./nsxt-3-0-install.html#nsxt30-mgmt-plane) in _Installing and Configuring NSX-T Data Center v3.0 for <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>_. Reserve any IP addresses from the subnet that are already in use, such as the IP for Ops Manager and subnet gateway.

    </table>

1. Select the **AZ-MGMT** Availability Zone to use with the `NET-MGMT-TKGI` network.

      <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Do not select the COMPUTE network at this point in the configuration. 
      It will be configured at the end of the procedure.</p>

1. Click **Save**.

    <%= image_tag("images/nsxt/bosh/config-bosh-17.png") %>

## <a id='assign-azs'></a>Step 6: Assign AZs and Networks

To configure the AZs and the Network for BOSH Director:

1. Select **Assign AZs and Networks** in BOSH Director.

    <%= image_tag("images/nsxt/bosh/config-bosh-18.png") %>

1. Use the drop-down menu to select a **Singleton Availability Zone**. The Ops Manager Director installs in this Availability Zone. For <%= vars.product_short %>, this will be the `AZ-MGMT` availability zone.

1. Use the drop-down menu to select a **Network** for BOSH Director. BOSH Director runs on the <%= vars.product_short %> Management Plane network. Select the `NST-MGTM-TKGI` network.

1. Click **Save**.

    <%= image_tag("images/nsxt/bosh/config-bosh-19.png") %>

## <a id='security-config'></a>Step 7: Configure Security

To configure a BOSH Director certificate and password:  

1. Select **Security** in BOSH Director.

1. In **Trusted Certificates**, enter a custom certificate authority (CA) certificate to insert into your organization's certificate trust chain. This feature allows all BOSH-deployed components in your deployment to trust a custom root certificate.<br/><br/>

	If you are using self-signed CAs for the infrastructure components (NSX-T, vCenter), you need to add every CA of every component your deployment may connect to. In other words, the bundle must include all certificates for any component that connects to or from BOSH. 

    If you are using a private Docker registry, such as VMware Harbor, use this field to enter the certificate for the registry. See [Integrating Harbor Registry with <%= vars.product_short %>](https://docs.pivotal.io/vmware-harbor/integrating-pks.html) for details.

1. Choose **Generate passwords** or **Use default BOSH password**. Use the **Generate passwords** option for increased security.

1. Click **Save**. To view your saved Director password, click the **Credentials** tab.

## <a id='bosh-dns'></a> Step 8: Configure BOSH DNS

To configure BOSH Director DNS:  

1. Select <strong>BOSH DNS Config</strong> in BOSH Director.

1. (Optional) In <strong>Excluded Recursors</strong>, enter a list of prohibited recursor addresses.

1. (Optional) In <strong>Recursor Timeout</strong>, enter a time limit for contacting the connected recursors. This includes dialing, writing, and reading from the recursor. If any of these actions exceeds the time limit you set, the action fails.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: This time limit must include one of the Go parse duration time units. For example, entering <code>5s</code> sets the timeout limit to five seconds. For more information about supported time units, see <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration">func ParseDuration</a> in the Go Programming Language documentation.</p></li>
1. (Optional) In <strong>Handlers</strong>, enter a list of custom domain handlers in JSON format.
1. Click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>

## <a id='syslog'></a>Step 9: Configure Logging

To configure BOSH Director logging:

1. Select **Syslog** in BOSH Director.

1. (Optional) To send BOSH Director system logs to a remote server, select **Yes**.

1. In the **Address** field, enter the IP address or DNS name for the remote server.

1. In the **Port** field, enter the port number that the remote server listens on.

1. In the **Transport Protocol** dropdown menu, select **TCP** or **UDP**. This selection determines which transport protocol is used to send the logs to the remote server.

1. (Optional) Select the **Enable TLS** checkbox to send encrypted logs to remote server with TLS. After you select the checkbox, perform the following steps:
  1. Enter either the name or SHA1 fingerprint of the remote peer in **Permitted Peer**.
  1. Enter the SSL certificate for the remote server in **SSL Certificate**.
<p class="note">**Note**: For an optimal security configuration, enable TLS encryption when you are forwarding logs. Logs can contain sensitive information, such as cloud provider credentials.</p>
1. (Optional) Enter an integer in **Queue Size**. This value specifies the number of log messages held in the buffer. The default value is 100,000.
1. (Optional) Select the checkbox to **Forward Debug Logs** to an external source. This option is deselected by default. If you select it, you may generate a large amount of log data.
1. (Optional) Enter configuration details for rsyslog in the **Custom rsyslog Configuration** field. This field requires the rainerscript syntax.
1. Click **Save Syslog Settings**.

## <a id='resource-config'></a>Step 10: Configure Resources

To configure BOSH Director resources:

1. Select **Resource Config** in BOSH Director.

1. Adjust any values as necessary for your deployment. Under the **Instances**, **Persistent Disk Type**, and **VM Type** fields,
choose **Automatic** from the drop-down menu to allocate the recommended resources for the job. If the **Persistent Disk Type** field reads **None**, the job does not require persistent disk space.

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Ops Manager requires a Director VM with at least 8&nbsp;GB memory.</p>

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you set a field to <strong>Automatic</strong> and the recommended resource allocation changes in a future version, Ops Manager automatically uses the updated recommended allocation.</p>

1. Click **Save**.

## <a id='custom-vm-extensions'></a> Step 11: (Optional) Add Custom VM Extensions

Use the Ops Manager API to add custom properties to your VMs such as associated security groups and load balancers. 

For more information, see [Managing Custom VM Extensions](https://docs.pivotal.io/ops-manager/install/custom-vm-extensions.html).

## <a id='deploy-bosh'></a>Step 12: Deploy BOSH
