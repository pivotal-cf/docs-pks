Pivotal Container Service (PKS) enables operators to provision, operate, and manage enterprise-grade Kubernetes clusters on Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF).

## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

PKS uses the [On-Demand Broker](https://docs.pivotal.io/svc-sdk/odb/index.html) to deploy [Cloud Foundry Container Runtime](https://docs-kubo.cfapps.io/), a BOSH release that offers a uniform way to instantiate, deploy, and manage highly available Kubernetes clusters on a cloud platform using BOSH.

After operators install the PKS tile on the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard, developers can provision Kubernetes clusters using the PKS Command Line Interface (PKS CLI), and run container-based workloads on the clusters with the Kubernetes CLI, [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/kubectl-overview/).

<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING</strong>: The PKS CLI is under active development and commands may change. To ensure you have installed the latest version, we recommend that you re-install the PKS CLI before you use it. To install the PKS CLI, see <a href="installing-pks-cli.html">Installing the PKS CLI</a>.</p>

## <a id='features'></a>Features

PKS has the following features:

* **Kubernetes Compatibility**: Constant compatibility with current stable release of Kubernetes

* **Production-ready**: Highly available from applications to infrastructure, with no single points of failure

* **BOSH advantages**: Built-in health checks, scaling, auto-healing and rolling upgrades

* **Fully automated operations**: Fully automated deploy, scale, patch, and upgrade experience

* **Multi-cloud**: Consistent operational experience across multiple clouds

* **GCP APIs access**: The Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Service Broker gives applications access to the Google Cloud APIs, and Google Container Engine (GKE) consistency enables the transfer of workloads from or to GCP

##<a id='components'></a> PKS Components

The PKS Controller contains the following components:

* An [On-Demand Broker](https://docs.pivotal.io/svc-sdk/odb/) that deploys [Cloud Foundry Container Runtime](https://docs-kubo.cfapps.io) (CFCR), an open-source project that provides a solution for deploying and managing [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/) clusters using [BOSH](https://bosh.io/docs).
* A Service Adapter
* The PKS API

NSX-T and Harbor are optional integrations for vSphere.

The GCP Service Broker is under development.

##<a id='installing'></a> Installing PKS

To install PKS, you must have a GCP or vSphere environment with Ops Manager v2.0 deployed.
If you are installing PKS to vSphere, you can also configure integration with NSX-T and Harbor.

Consult the following table:

<table>
<tr>
<th>IaaS</th>
<th>Ops Manager v2.0</th>
<th>NSX-T</th>
<th>Harbor</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>vSphere</td>
<td>Required</td>
<td>Available</td>
<td>Available</td>
</tr>
<td>GCP</td>
<td>Required</td>
<td>Not Available</td>
<td>Not Available</td>
</tr>
</table>

For information about the requirements for installing PKS, see the topic that corresponds to your cloud provider:

* [GCP Prerequisites and Resource Requirements](gcp-requirements.html)
* [vSphere Prerequisites and Resource Requirements](vsphere-requirements.html)

## <a id='managing'></a>Managing PKS

See [Managing PKS](managing.html) for information about managing PKS.

## <a id='using'></a>Using PKS

After [installing](installing.html) PKS, you can use the PKS Command Line Interface (PKS CLI) commands to do the following:

* [Create](using.html#create-cluster) a Kubernetes cluster
* [Retrieve the credentials and configuration](using.html#get-credentials) for a Kubernetes cluster so that you can deploy application workloads to the cluster with `kubectl`, the Kubernetes CLI
* [View](using.html#view-cluster-list) the list of running Kubernetes clusters
* [View](using.html#view-cluster) details about a Kubernetes cluster
* [View](using.htmlview-cluster-plans) the list of available plans for deploying a Kubernetes cluster
* [Resize](using.html#resize) the number of worker nodes in a Kubernetes cluster
* [Access](using.html#access-dashboard) the Dashboard for a Kubernetes cluster
* [Deploy](using.html#deploy-access-workloads) and access basic workloads
* [Delete](using.html#delete-cluster) a Kubernetes cluster

See [Using PKS](using.html) for information about using PKS.
