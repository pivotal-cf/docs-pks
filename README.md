## How To Use Bookbinder To View Your Documentation

[Bookbinder](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/bookbinder/blob/master/README.md) is a command-line
utility for stitching Markdown documents into a hostable web app. The documentation team uses
Bookbinder to publish our documentation sites, but you can also use Bookbinder to view a live
version of your documentation on your local machine.

Bookbinder draws the content for the site from this repository, the left navigation menu ("subnav")
from [`docs-book-pks`](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/docs-book-pks), and various layout
configuration and assets from [`docs-layout-repo`](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/docs-layout-repo).

To use Bookbinder to view your documentation, perform the following steps:

1. Clone this repository to the `~/workspace` directory on your local machine.
1. Clone [`docs-book-pks`](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/docs-book-pks) and [`docs-layout-repo`](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/docs-layout-repo) to the `~/workspace` directory on your local machine.
1. Navigate into the `docs-book-pks` directory.
1. Run `bundle install` to install all of the necessary gems, including Bookbinder.
1. Run `bundle exec bookbinder bind local` to build a Rack web-app of the book. After the bind has completed, navigate into the `final_app` directory and run `rackup`. Then navigate to `localhost:9292/tkgi/1-10/index.html` in a browser.
