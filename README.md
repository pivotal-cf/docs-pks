## How To Use Bookbinder To View Your Docs

[Bookbinder](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/bookbinder/blob/master/README.md) is a command-line utility for stitching Markdown docs into a hostable web app. The PCF Docs Team uses Bookbinder to publish our documentation sites, but you can also use Bookbinder to view a live version of your documentation on your local machine.

Bookbinder draws the content for the site from this repo, the left navigation menu ("subnav") from [`docs-book-pks`](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/docs-book-pks), and various layout configuration and assets from [`docs-layout-repo`](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/docs-layout-repo).

To use Bookbinder to view your documentation, perform the following steps:

1. Clone this repo to the `~/workspace` directory on your local machine.
1. Clone [`docs-book-pks`](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/docs-book-pks) and [`docs-layout-repo`](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/docs-layout-repo) to the `~/workspace` directory on your local machine.
1. Change into the `docs-book-pks` directory.
1. Run `bundle install` to install all of the necessary gems, including Bookbinder.
1. Build your documentation site with `bookbinder` in one of the two following ways:
  * Run `bundle exec bookbinder watch` to build an interactive version of the docs and navigate to `localhost:4567/myservice/` in a browser. (It may take a moment for the site to load at first.) This builds a site from your content repo at `docs-content`, and then watches that repo to update the site if you make any changes to the repo.
  * Run `bundle exec bookbinder bind local` to build a Rack web-app of the book. After the bind has completed, `cd` into the `final_app` directory and run `rackup`. Then navigate to `localhost:9292/myservice/` in a browser.
