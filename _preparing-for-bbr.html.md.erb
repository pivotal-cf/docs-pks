Before you use BBR to either back up <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> or restore <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> from backup,
follow these steps to retrieve deployment information and credentials:

* [Verify your BBR Version](#verify-bbr-version)
* [Retrieve the BBR SSH Credentials](#bbr-ssh-creds)
* [Retrieve the BOSH Director Credentials](#bosh-creds)
* [Retrieve the UAA Client Credentials](#cluster-creds)
* [Retrieve the BOSH Director Address](#bosh-address)
* [Download the Root CA Certificate](#root-ca-cert)
* [Retrieve the BOSH Command Line Credentials](#bosh-cli-creds)
* [Retrieve Your Cluster Deployment Names](#cluster-deployment-name)

### <a id='verify-bbr-version'></a> Verify Your BBR Version

Before running BBR, verify that the installed version of BBR is compatible with your deployment's current <%= vars.product_short %> release.

1. For your current <%= vars.product_short %> release's minimum version information, see the [<%= vars.product_short %> Release Notes](release-notes.html).  

1. To verify the currently installed BBR version, run the following command:

    ```
    bbr version  
    ```

If you do not have BBR installed, or your installed version does not meet the minimum version requirement, 
see [Installing BOSH Backup and Restore](bbr-install.html).
