This topic describes how to define Network Profiles for customizing Kubernetes node networks provisioned 
with <%= vars.product_full %> (<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>) on vSphere with NSX.

For information on how to define Network Profiles for other cluster customizations, 
see [Creating and Managing Network Profiles (NSX Only)](network-profiles-define.html).  

## <a id='nodes'></a> Configurable Node Network IP Blocks

You can use Network Profiles to configure a Kubernetes cluster with a custom Node Network IP Block.  

A Network Profile **Node IP Block** is used by <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> to assign address space to Kubernetes nodes when new clusters are deployed 
or a cluster increases its scale.  
	
Your Network Profile Node IP Block configuration can define one or more custom Node IP Block networks, 
specify the size of the node subnet, and specify if the network is routable:  
	
* **Node IP Block IDs**: The network profile `node_ip_block_ids` parameter allows you to specify one or more Kubernetes node network Nodes IP Blocks for your clusters.  

    When a network profile with a `node_ip_block_ids` configuration is applied to a Kubernetes cluster, <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> automatically creates a node subnet from one of the available IP blocks.  
	
    You can upscale an existing node network configuration by adding new node subnets to the `node_ip_block_ids` configuration and applying the network profile to the cluster. 
    You cannot remove an existing node subnet from a cluster.  
	
    If the IP block is exhausted, the cluster uses one of the alternate IP blocks specified in the `node_ip_block_ids` configuration to create the Nodes subnet.  

* **Node Routable**: The `node_routable` boolean lets you specify if the Node network is routable or non-routable. 
    This is the equivalent of enabling or deactivating NAT mode in the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> tile.  
	
    If the Node network is configured as non-routable, `"node_routable":false`, the Node network uses NAT mode. In this case, you must make sure that Kubernetes nodes 
    have access to BOSH and other <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Management Plane components. 
    See [Create Management Plane](./nsxt-3-0-install.html#nsxt30-mgmt-plane) in _Installing and Configuring NSX-T Data Center v3.0 for <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>_ 
    for more information.  
	
	If the Node network is configured as routable, `"node_routable":true`, the IP address space must be an externally routable address block.  

    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The default routable setting for the Node network is determined based on the selection made in the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> tile. If <strong>NAT mode</strong> is selected, the Node network is non-routable. To override the default selection, provide the <code>node_routable</code> parameter in the network profile.</p>

* **Node Subnet Prefix**:  Configure the Node IP Block `node_subnet_prefix` parameter to specify a subnet size 
    that optimizes the use of network address space for the number of nodes in your Kubernetes cluster.  

    For example, if the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> administrator has configured the default in the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> tile 
	to be a Routable network for the Nodes IP Block, the Kubernetes cluster administrator can deploy the cluster in the NAT'ed mode (non-routable) 
	by specifying a network profile with an IP block that supports the NAT'ed address range.  

    By default, each Kubernetes cluster deployed by <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> is allocated a /24 subnet, 
    which allows up to 256 IP addresses to be assigned.  

    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Configure <strong>Node Subnet Prefix</strong> when your cluster nodes 
	use a globally routable address space with the <code>`node_routable</code> option set to "true".</p>
