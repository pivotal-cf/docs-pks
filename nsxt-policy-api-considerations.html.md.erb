This topic provides considerations for using the NSX-T Policy API with Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition (TKGI) on vSphere.

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong>
    Support for the NSX-T Policy API is currently in beta and is intended for evaluation and test purposes only. 
    Do not use this feature in a production environment.

##<a id='overview'></a>NSX-T Policy API Support (Beta)

The NSX-T Policy API is the next-generation interface for integrating with the NSX-T networking and security framework. 

In addition to supporting the NSX-T Management API, <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> supports using the NSX-T Policy API to deploy <%= vars.product_short %> on vSphere.

If you are planning on using the NSX-T Policy API, keep in mind that only new deployments of TKGI are supported. You cannot configure an existing installation of TKGI to use the NSX-T Policy API. 

In addition, while all TKGI functionality is supported in both NSX-T modes, Policy and Management, there are some differences to be aware of when configuring NSX-T objects for TKGI, and when configuring the BOSH and TKGI tiles. These differences are described in more detail below.

## <a id='nsxt-policy-versions'></a>NSX-T Versions

To use the NSX-T Policy API with your TKGI installation, you must use a supported NSX-T version. Refer to the [Release Notes](./release-notes.html).

## <a id='nsxt-policy-toplogy'></a>NSX-T Deployment Topologies

<%= vars.product_short %> on vSphere with NSX-T supports several [deployment topologies](./nsxt-topologies.html). 

Currently <%= vars.product_short %> on vSphere with NSX-T Policy API supports all network topologies except the [VSS/VDS topology](./nsxt-topologies.html#topology-no-nat-virtual-switch).

## <a id='nsxt-policy-intall'></a>NSX-T Installation

To use the NSX-T Policy API, there are no changes required to the installation of the main NSX-T components, including NSX Manager and Edge Nodes. 

For installation instructions, see [Installing Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition on vSphere with NSX-T Data Center](vsphere-nsxt-index-install.html).

## <a id='nsxt-policy-obects'></a>NSX-T Objects for Kubernetes Clusters

To use the NSX-T Policy API, you must configure the required NSX-T control plane objects using the NSX-T Policy API or UI. Specifically, you must configure the Tier-0 Router (called Gateway in the Policy terminology), the Nodes IP Block, the Pods IP Block, and the Floating IP Pool need to be created using the Policy API or UI.

For specific instructions on creating the required objects, see [Create the NSX-T Objects for Kubernetes Clusters Provisioned by TKGI](nsxt-install-objects-k8s.html).

## <a id='nsxt-policy-config'></a>TKGI Configuration

When you configure the BOSH Director tile for <%= vars.product_short %>, you must enable the option vCenter Config > NSX-T Networking > **Use NSX-T Policy API**. See [Configure NSX-T Networking](./vsphere-nsxt-om-config.html#vcenter-config).

Also, when you configure the TKGI tile in Ops Manager, you must enabled Settings > Networking > NSX-T > **Policy API mode**. See [Configure TKGI Networking](./installing-nsx-t.html#networking).

## <a id='nsxt-policy-mgmt-console'></a>Management Console

If you are using the TKGI Management Console, you need to select the Policy API in the TKGI configuration section.

## <a id='nsxt-policy-runtime'></a>Network Profile

<%= vars.product_short %> on vSphere with NSX-T supports the use of [Network Profile](./network-profiles-index.html) for modifying specific NSX-T settings post-installation. A limited number of network profile use cases are not supported when using TKGI with the NSX-T Policy API.

The <%= vars.product_short %> on vSphere with NSX-T Policy API does not support either the "Top Firewall" or the "Bottom Firewall" DFW Section Markers. For more information, see [DFW Section Markers](./network-profiles-ncp-dfw.html).  

The <%= vars.product_short %> on vSphere with NSX-T Policy API does not support [NSGroups](./network-profiles-ns-groups.html) if you create the group in a domain other than the default. With the Policy API, a group must be part of a domain. The `default` domain is supported, and if you create the group using the NSX-T Policy interface, the group is automatically put in the `default` domain. However, if you use the Policy REST API to create a group in a domain other than the default, it is not supported.
