title: Configuring a GCP Load Balancer for the PKS API
owner: PKS

<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic describes how to create a load balancer for the PKS API using Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

Before you install PKS, you must configure an external TCP load balancer to access the PKS API from outside the network.
You can use any external TCP load balancer of your choice.

Refer to the procedures in this topic to create a load balancer using GCP.
If you choose to use a different load balancer, use the configuration in this topic as a guide.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: This procedure uses example commands which you should modify to represent the details of your PKS installation.</p>

## <a id='create-lb'></a>Step 1: Create a Load Balancer

To create a load balancer using GCP, perform the following steps:

1. In a browser, navigate to the [GCP console](https://console.cloud.google.com).

1. Navigate to **Network Services > Load balancing** and click **CREATE LOAD BALANCER**.

1. Under **TCP Load Balancing**, click **Start configuration**.

1. Select whether you want to load balance traffic from the Internet to your VMs or only between your VMs.

1. Select whether you want to place the backends for your load balancer in a single region or across multiple regions.

1. Give your load balancer a name. Pivotal recommends naming your load balancer `pks-api`.

1. Select **Backend configuration**.
   * Under **Region**, select the region where you deployed Ops Manager.
   * Under **Backends**, leave **Select existing instance groups** selected. You point the PKS API instance to the backend later in this procedure.
   * (Optional) Select a backup pool.
   * (Optional) Select whether you want to create a health check or go without one.
   * Select a session affinity configuration.
   * (Optional) Select **Advanced configurations** to configure the **Connection draining timeout**.

1. Select **Frontend configuration**.
   * (Optional) Give your frontend a name.
   * (Optional) Give your frontend a description.
   * Select **Create IP address** to reserve an IP address for the PKS API endpoint.
      1. Enter a name for your reserved IP address. For example, `pks-api-ip`. GCP assigns a static IP address that appears next to the name.
      1. (Optional) Enter a description.
      1. Click **Reserve**.
   * Under **Ports**, enter 8443 and 9021. Your external load balancer forwards traffic to the PKS control plane VM using the UAA endpoint on port 8443 and the PKS API endpoint on port 9021.
   * Click **Done**.

1. Click **Review and finalize** to review your load balancer configuration.

1. Click **Create**.

## <a id='firewall-rule'></a>Step 2: Create a Firewall Rule

To create a firewall rule that allows traffic between the load balancer and the PKS API VM, do the following:

1. From the GCP console, navigate to **VPC Network > Firewall rules** and click **CREATE FIREWALL RULE**.

1.  Configure the following:
   * Give your firewall rule a name.
   * (Optional) Give your firewall rule a description.
   * Under **Network**, select the VPC network you created in [Step 3: Create a GCP Network with Subnets](gcp-prepare-env.html#create-network) of _Preparing to Deploy PKS on GCP_.
   * Under **Priority**, enter a priority number between 0 and 65535.
   * Under **Direction of traffic**, select **Ingress**.
   * Under **Action on match**, select **Allow**.
   * Under **Targets**, select the load balancer you created in the previous section.
   * Under **Target tags**, enter `pks-api`.
   * Under **Source filter**, select **IP ranges**.
   * Under **Source IP ranges**, enter `0.0.0.0/0`.
   * Under **Protocols and ports**, select **Specified protocols and ports** and enter `tcp:8443,9021`.

1. Click **Create**.

## <a id='tag'></a>Step 3: Create a Network Tag for the Firewall Rule

To apply the firewall rule to the VM that hosts the PKS API, the VM must have the `pks-api` tag in GCP. Do the following:

1. From the GCP console, navigate to **Compute Engine** > **VM instances**.
1. Locate the your PKS control plane VM.
1. Click the name of the VM to open the **VM instance details** menu.
1. Click **Edit**.
1. Verify that the **Network tags** field contains the `pks-api` tag. If the tag does not appear in the field, enter it now.
1. Scroll to the bottom of the screen and click **Save**.

## <a id='wildcard-dns-entry'></a>Step 4: Create a Wildcard DNS Entry

To create a wildcard DNS entry in GCP for your PKS API domain, do the following:

1. From the GCP console, navigate to **Network Services > Cloud DNS**.

1. If you do not already have a DNS zone, click **Create zone**.
   * Give a **Zone name** and a **DNS name**.
   * Specify whether the **DNSSEC** state of the zone is **Off**, **On**, or **Transfer**.
   * (Optional) Enter a **Description**.
   * Click **Create**.

1. Click **Add record set**.

1. Under **DNS Name**, enter a subdomain for the load balancer. For example, to use `pks-api.pks.example.com` as your PKS API hostname, enter `pks-api` in this field.

1. Select a **Resource Record Type**, **TTL**, and **TTL Unit**.

1. Enter the static IP address that GCP assigned when you created the load balancer in [Step 1: Create a Load Balancer](#create-lb).

1. Click **Create**.

After you complete this procedure, follow the instructions in [Installing and Configuring PKS](installing-pks.html) to deploy PKS.
