title: Migrating to Policy API - Overview
owner: TKGI
---


## <a id="features"></a> Migration features

- The MP2P migration feature enables existing environments using MP API to be upgraded to use policy API
    - It migrates clusters corresponding NSX resources to Policy objects without disrupting NSX data path. 
    - In the meanwhile synchronizes all NSX resources to Policy IDs in the cluster deployment including
        - cluster bosh deployment properties
        - cluster attached network profile

- Designed to be self-service:
    - A series of NSX Manager and TKGI CLI configuration steps

- Clusters are migrated one by one, limiting impact to the cluster being migrated

- The cluster being migrated will experience some downtime, other clusters will be unaffected 

- Once the migration is started, you cannot roll back to MP API.


### <a id="features-tkgi"></a> TKGI features

- Lose TKGIMC support after TKGI foundation migration
- NSXT cert rotation not support during TKGI foundation migration

### <a id="features-more"></a> More (features?)

- "Admin" DFW rules, NSX administrator intervenes
- Migration on cluster with Shared NSGroup for control plane VMs not support at first release https://docs.pivotal.io/tkgi/1-13/network-profiles-ns-groups.html 
- BOSH configuration for Policy API migration mode: CLI/API way only at first release, but will have UI in later releases 
- Entire NSXT can be converted to Policy after TKGI migrated to Policy


### <a id="features-supported-topology"></a> Supported Migration Topologies

NCP MP2P can infer the shared resources for the following topologies:  

- single tier0 topology  
    - Tier0 AS mode  (shared tier1 cluster, dedicate tier1 cluster)  
    - Tier0 AA mode  
- multi tier0 topology  
    - Tier0 AA mode  
- No-NAT with Virtual Switch (VSS/VDS) topology

## <a id="concerns"></a> Concerns

- Some complex environments may need PSO assistance
- The cluster being migrated will experience some downtime, other clusters will be unaffected 
- Once the migration is started, you cannot roll back to MP API.
- Do not intentionally plan to run your environment in mixed mode for an extended period of time


### <a id="concerns-limitations"></a> Operations limitations

- Cluster migration, serially (sending multiple migration requests simultaneously not supported in NSX)
- NSX Manager cluster with VIP, customer needs to configure source IP persistence profile for LB or use source IP LB algorithm during TKGI foundation migration

**During Migration**

For the cluster under migration:
- You cannot operate cluster
- You cannot create/update/delete new workloads and existing workloads
- Your existing workloads will have some application downtime (expecting the time of rolling update all worker nodes when updating the cluster) but should be recovered after migration
- It takes time approximate to the time on NSX resources migration (depending on scale) and the time to update this cluster

While the environment consists of not-migrated MP clusters and migrated Policy API clusters:
- You can still CRUD clusters (Of course, it requires bosh Policy API migration mode configured at the beginning steps)
- You can still CRUD workloads
- Your existing workloads run as usual

VMware recommends that you reduce the possibility of issues by migrating all clusters as soon as possible and minimize the migration mix-mode maintenance window.



## <a id="faqs"></a> Migration FAQs

**What is BOSH Policy API migration mode???**  

During whole migration process, the migrated policy clusters and not migrated MP clusters can still be used. 
You can CRUD the clusters and also the workloads on clusters.

To support this MIXing status on nodes lifecycle, BOSH exposes Policy API migration mode during this period. 

TKGI doesn't expose additional migration mode. 
TKGI can just magically handle this MIXing status with internal additional coding support.



**How to configure BOSH Policy API migration mode???**  

Opsman 3.0 will have UI dropdown to choose to configure BOSH tile.

Before that, we can use Ops Manager CLI to configure it (documentation).



**Why migrate one cluster first?**  

Each cluster migration will migrate shared resources (tier0, floating ippool, pod ipblock, node ipblock).
To continue step2 of updating TKGI, we need the shared resources migrated to Policy first. So we need at least 1 cluster migrated then we can update TKGI.
