This topic provides an overview of the issues to consider before migrating <%= vars.product_full %> (<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>) from the Management Plane API to Policy API.  
 
To migrate a <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> from Management Plane API to Policy API, 
see [Migrating the Management Plane API to Policy API](mp2p-migration.html).  


<br>
## <a id="overview"></a> Overview

The Management Plane API to Policy API (MP2P) Migration feature 
switches environments using the Management Plane API <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> to the Policy API.  

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> 
<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> supports Management Plane API to Policy API Migration only.
You cannot return <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> to the Management Plane API 
after starting <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> MP2P Migration.
</p> 

<br>
### <a id="features"></a> Management Plane API to Policy API Migration Features

<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Management Plane API to Policy API Migration provides 
the following advantages over manual migration:  

* Designed to be self-service.  

* Reduces a complex manual workflow to a few procedures:  
    
    * Automates NCP MP2P functions.  
    * Automates most NSX Manager and TKGI CLI configuration steps.  
    * Migrates cluster NSX resources to Policy API objects without disrupting NSX data path.  
    * Synchronizes all cluster deployment NSX resources to Policy IDs, 
    including Network Profile configurations and BOSH deployment properties.  
    * Designed to be a self-service feature for <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> admins in most environments.  

* Reduces the impact on the workloads in your environment:  

    * By promoting clusters to Policy API one by one, 
    the MP2P Migration procedure limits downtime impact 
    to only the cluster being promoted.  Other clusters continue to operate as usual.  

* Supports migrating common topologies.

## <a id="concerns"></a> Concerns and Limitations  

Before initiating <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> MP2P, consider the following limitations:  

* [Operational Limitations](#concerns-limitations)  
* [Other Considerations](#concerns-considerations)  

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> 
To reduce the possibility of unexpected issues, 
<%= vars.recommended_by %> recommends that you minimize the duration of your MP2P Migration mix-mode maintenance window
by promoting all clusters as soon as possible.
</p> 


<br>
### <a id="concerns-limitations"></a> Operational Limitations  

Review the following and resolve concerns before initiating <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> MP2P Migration:  

* [Before MP2P Migration](#concerns-limitations-before)  
* [During MP2P Migration](#concerns-limitations-during)  
* [During Cluster Promotion to Policy API](#concerns-limitations-during-cluster)  

<br>
#### <a id="concerns-limitations-before"></a> Before MP2P Migration

Consider the following before initiating <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> MP2P Migration:  

* Evaluate the complexity of your <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> environment. 
PSO assistance might be required to migrate some complex environments.  

* Migrate clusters serially. Do not attempt to migrate multiple clusters in parallel. 
    NSX does not support multiple simultaneous MP2P Migration requests.  
* **If your NSX Manager cluster uses VIP, you must configure a source IP persistence profile for your load balancer or use a source IP LB algorithm while migrating the TKGI foundation.**  
**This limitation needs engineering clarification.**  


<br>
#### <a id="concerns-limitations-during"></a> During MP2P Migration

During your MP2P Migration mix-mode maintenance window:  

* You cannot roll back your <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> environment to the Management Plane API.  
* You cannot rotate NSXT certificates.  

Migrate your entire <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> environment to the Policy API as quickly as possible. 
Do not assume you can run <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> as a Management Plane/Policy API mixed environment 
for an extended period of time.  

    
<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> 
Do not upgrade NSX or <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>  while your environment is in MP2P Migration mixed-mode.
</p> 


<br>
#### <a id="concerns-limitations-during-cluster"></a> During Cluster Promotion to Policy API

Promote your clusters the Policy API serially only while the MP2P Migration mix-mode maintenance window is active.  

Promoting a cluster to Policy API includes migrating NSX resources, updating the cluster, 
and rolling updates out to all of the cluster's worker nodes.  

While promoting a cluster to Policy API:  

* The cluster being promoted:  

    * Cannot be operated.  
    * Cannot be modified using the TKGI CLI.  
    * Cluster workloads cannot be added/created, updated or deleted.  
    * Existing workloads on the cluster being promoted will have some application downtime.  

* The clusters that are not actively being promoted:  

    * Can be managed as usual.  
    * Workloads on these clusters can be managed.  
    * Workloads on these clusters continue to run as usual.  


<br>
### <a id="concerns-considerations"></a> Other Considerations

In addition to the [Operational Limitations](#concerns-limitations) above, 
consider the following before initiating <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> MP2P Migration:  

* Your <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Management Console will not support <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> 
after <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> MP2P Migration.  
* Migrate remaining NSX object to Policy API only after <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> MP2P Migration to Policy API has completed.

## <a id="faqs"></a> MP2P Migration FAQs 

Frequently asked MP2P Migration questions:

* [What is BOSH Policy API migration mode?](#faqs-what-is)  
* [How to configure BOSH Policy API migration mode?](#faqs-how-to-configure)  
* [Why migrate one cluster first?](#faqs-why-one)  

<br>
### <a id="faqs-what-is"></a>What is BOSH Policy API Migration Mode?  

By default, BOSH is configured for clusters using the Management Plane API and not for supporting clusters using Policy API. 
To promote clusters to the Policy API, your environment must support both your clusters that continue to use the Management Plane API 
and those you have promoted to Policy API. To support both, activate BOSH Policy API Migration Mode.  


During whole migration process, the migrated policy clusters and not migrated MP clusters can still be used. 
You can CRUD the clusters and also the workloads on clusters.

To support this MIXing status on nodes lifecycle, BOSH exposes Policy API migration mode during this period. 

TKGI doesn't expose additional migration mode. 
TKGI can just magically handle this MIXing status with internal additional coding support.



<br>
### <a id="faqs-how-to-configure"></a>How to configure BOSH Policy API Migration Mode?

<% if vars.product_version == "v1.15"  %>
Use 
<% else %>
If you use Ops Manager v3.0 or later, you have the option to activate BOSH Policy API Migration Mode directly on the Ops Manager UI. 
Otherwise, use
<% end %>
the Ops Manager CLI to activate BOSH Policy API migration mode.  


<br>
### <a id="faqs-why-one"></a>Why migrate one cluster first?

Each cluster migration will migrate shared resources (tier0, floating ippool, pod ipblock, node ipblock).
To continue step2 of updating TKGI, we need the shared resources migrated to Policy first. So we need at least 1 cluster migrated then we can update TKGI.
