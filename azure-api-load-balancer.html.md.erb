title: Configuring an Azure Load Balancer for the TKGI API
owner: TKGI
---

This topic describes how to create a load balancer for the <%= vars.product_full %> API (<%= vars.control_plane %>) using Microsoft Azure.

Refer to the procedures in this topic to create a load balancer using Azure. To use a different
load balancer, use this topic as a guide.

##<a id='overview'></a> Overview

<%= vars.recommended_by %> recommends that you create a <%= vars.control_plane %>
load balancer when installing <%= vars.product_short %> on Azure.
You simplify future upgrades of <%= vars.product_short %> by creating a load balancer when installing.

To configure your <%= vars.control_plane %> Load Balancer on Azure, complete the following:

* [Create a Load Balancer](#create-load-balancer)
* [Create a Backend Pool](#create-backend-pool)
* [Create Health Probes](#create-health-probes)
* [Create Load Balancing Rules](#create-load-balancing-role)
* [Create an Inbound Security Rule](#create-inbound-rule)
* [Add the <%= vars.control_plane %> to the Backend Pool](#add-api-to-backend-pool)
* [Verify <%= vars.control_plane %> Hostname Resolution](#verify)

1. From the Azure Dashboard, open the **Load Balancers** service.
1. Click the name of the load balancer that you created in [Create Load Balancer](#create) above.
1. On your load balancer page, locate and record the IP address of your load balancer.
1. In the **Settings** menu, select **Backend pools**.
1. To add a new backend pool, click **Add** and complete the **Backend pools** form as follows:
  1. **Name**: Enter the name for the backend pool.
  1. Click **Add**.

For information about Azure backend pools, see [Backend pools](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/frontdoor/front-door-backend-pool#backend-pools)
in the Azure documentation. For more information about configuring your backend pool, see
[Remove or add VMs from the backend pool](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/load-balancer/tutorial-load-balancer-standard-manage-portal#remove-or-add-vms-from-the-backend-pool)
in the Azure documentation.

##<a id='create-health-probes'></a> Create Health Probes

To create health probes for your load balancer and UAA:

1. From the Azure Dashboard, open the **Load Balancers** service.
1. To open the **Health probes** page, select **Health probes** in the **Settings** menu.
1. To create a new <%= vars.control_plane %> server health probe, click **Add** and complete the form as follows:
  1. **Name**: Enter the name for the health probe.
  1. **Protocol**: Select **TCP**.
  1. **Port**: Enter `9021`.
  1. **Interval**: Enter the interval of time to wait between probe attempts.
  1. **Unhealthy Threshold**: Enter a number of consecutive probe failures that must occur before
    a VM is considered unhealthy.
1. To create a new UAA health probe, click **Add** and complete the form as follows:
  1. **Name**: Enter the name for the UAA health probe.
  1. **Protocol**: Select **TCP**.
  1. **Port**: Enter `8443`.
  1. **Interval**: Enter the interval of time to wait between probe attempts.
  1. **Unhealthy Threshold**: Enter a number of consecutive probe failures that must occur before
    a VM is considered unhealthy.
1. Click **OK**.

##<a id='create-load-balancing-role'></a> Create Load Balancing Rules

To create load balancer rules for your load balancer:

1. From the Azure Dashboard, open the **Load Balancers** service.
1. To open the **Load balancing rules** page, select **Load Balancing Rules** in the **Settings** menu.
1. To create a new <%= vars.control_plane %> server load balancer rule, click **Add** and complete the **Add load balancing rules** form as follows:
  1. **Name**: Enter a name for the load balancing rule.
  1. **IP Version**: Select **IPv4**.
  1. **Frontend IP address**: Select the appropriate IP address. Clients communicate with your load
    balancer on the selected IP address and service traffic is routed to the target VM by this NAT
    rule.
  1. **Protocol**: Select **TCP**.
  1. **Port**: Enter `9021`.
  1. **Backend port**: Enter `9021`.
  1. **Health Probe**: Select the <%= vars.control_plane %> server health probe that you created in
    [Create Health Probe](#create-health-probes) above.
  1. **Session persistence**: Select **None**.
1. To create a new UAA load balancer rule, click **Add** and complete the **Add load balancing rules** form as follows:

1. Click the **<%= vars.product_tile %>** tile.
1. Open the **Resource Config** pane.

After you have configured an Azure load balancer for the <%= vars.control_plane %>,
complete the <%= vars.product_short %> installation by returning to the
