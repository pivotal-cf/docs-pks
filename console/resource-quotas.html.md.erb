title: Assign Resource Quotas to Users
owner: PKS
---

After you have added users to your <%= vars.product_short %> deployment and assigned the cluster manager or admin role to them, you can optionally assign resource quotas to them. By setting quotas, you can limit the amount of compute power and memory that those users can consume. You can also set a limit on the number of clusters that they can deploy.

1. Go to the **Quotas** view of the management console.

1. Click **Add Quota** and select the users to whom to apply the quota.

    Only users who have the cluster manager role appear in the list.

1. Enter maximums for the number of virtual CPUs and the amount of memory that the selected users can consume, and the number of clusters they can create.

    You can also use the **Unlimited** toggles to allow the users unrestricted access to resources.

To update the resources assigned to a user, or to delete a quota, select the quota and click either **Edit** or **Delete**.
