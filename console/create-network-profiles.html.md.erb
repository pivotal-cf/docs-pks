title: Create Network Profiles in the Management Console
owner: PKS
---

If you deployed Enterprise PKS Management Console to an NSX-T Data Center environment, you can create different network profiles for your clusters. Network profiles allow you to customize NSX-T Data Center parameters to suit different types of cluster. If you have created network profiles, you select which profile to use each time you deploy a cluster from the management console.

For examples of when you might use network profiles, see [Network Profile Use Cases](../network-profiles-define.html#use-cases).
â€‹
If you do not create network profiles, all clusters use the default NSX-T Data Center settings that you configured when you deployed the management console.

1. Go to the **Network Profiles** view of the management console.
