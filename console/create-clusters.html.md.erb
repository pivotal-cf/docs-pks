1. Use the **Plan** drop-down menu to select one of the plans that were configured during the deployment of <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console.

    The plan defines the set of resources that the Kubernetes cluster will use. A summary of the selected plan appears as you hover over each option.

1. Enter a name and a host name for the cluster, and specify the number of worker nodes to create.

1. Use the Network Profile drop-down menu to select a network profile for the cluster to use.

    Network profiles allow you to customize the networking for different types of Kubernetes cluster. A summary of the selected profile appears as you hover over each option. If you have not created any network profiles, you can use the default network profile. If you select the default network profile, <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console configures networking for you, based on the plan that you selected.
1. Click **Save** to deploy your cluster.

    You can follow the progress of the deployment of your cluster in the **Clusters** tab.

1. When your cluster is running, optionally select it in the **Clusters** tab and click **Update**.
    ![Update cluster](images/update-cluster.png)
1. Optionally update the number of worker nodes, change the network profile, or expand **Advanced Settings** to update the settings for node drain and the pod shutdown grace period.

To delete a cluster than you no longer require, select it in the **Clusters** tab and click **Delete**.
