You can add individual users or user groups to <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console. You can assign the Cluster Manager and PKS Administrator roles to individual users or to groups. If you assign a role to a group, all of the users in that group have that role.

For information about the tasks that Cluster Managers can perform, see [Enterprise PKS Architecture](../control-plane.html). The PKS Administrator role allows users to manage the <%= vars.product_short %> infrastructure.
