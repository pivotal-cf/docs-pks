1. To specify your level of participation in the CEIP and Telemetry program, select one of the **Participation Level** options:  
  * **None:** If you select this option, data is not collected from your <%= vars.product_short %> installation.
  * (Default) **Standard:** If you select this option, data is collected from your <%= vars.product_short %> installation to improve <%= vars.product_short %>. This participation level is anonymous and does not permit the CEIP and Telemetry to identify your organization.
  * **Enhanced:** If you select this option, data is collected from your <%= vars.product_short %> installation to provide you proactive support and other benefits. This participation level permits the CEIP and Telemetry to identify your organization.

  If you are a Pivotal customer, you can find your Pivotal Customer Number in your Pivotal Order Confirmation email.  
  * (Optional) Enter a descriptive name for your PKS installation in the **PKS Installation Label** field. 
  The label you assign to this installation will be used in telemetry reports to identify the environment.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If you join the CEIP and Telemetry Program for <%= vars.product_short %>, open your firewall to allow outgoing access to 
	<code>https://vcsa.vmware.com/ph</code> on port <code>443</code>.</p>
<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Even if you select <strong>None</strong>, <%= vars.product_short %>-provisioned clusters send usage data to the PKS control plane. 
	However, this data is not sent to VMware or Pivotal and remains on your <%= vars.product_short %> installation.</p>
