Perform the following steps:

1. Click **Assign AZs and Networks**.

1. Select the availability zone (AZ) where you want to deploy the PKS API VM as a singleton job.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: You must select an additional AZ for balancing other jobs before clicking <strong>Save</strong>, but this selection has no effect in the current version of PKS.</p>

    ![Assign AZs and Networks pane in Ops Manager](images/azs-networks.png)

1. Under **Network**, select the infrastructure subnet you created for the PKS API VM.
1. Under **Service Network**, select the services subnet you created for Kubernetes cluster VMs.
1. Click **Save**.

###<a id='pks-api'></a> PKS API

Perform the following steps:

1. Click **PKS API**.
1. Under **Certificate to secure the PKS API**, provide your own wildcard certificate and private key pair.
  ![PKS API pane configuration](images/pks-api.png)
The certificate you enter here should cover the domain that routes to the PKS broker VM with TLS termination on the ingress.<br><br>
    (Optional) If you do not have a certificate and private key pair, you can have Ops Manager generate one for you. Perform the following steps:
  1. Select the **Generate RSA Certificate** link.
  1. Enter the wildcard domain for your API hostname.
    For example, if your PKS API domain is `api.pks.example.com`, then enter `*.pks.example.com`.
  1. Click **Generate**.
1. Under **API Hostname (FQDN)**, enter a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) to access the PKS API.
For example, `api.pks.example.com`.
1. Click **Save**.

###<a id='usage'></a> Usage Data

VMware’s Customer Experience Improvement Program (“CEIP”) and the Pivotal Insights Program
(“Insights”) provides VMware and Pivotal with information that enables the companies to improve their
products and services, fix problems, and advise you on how best to deploy and use our products.
As part of the CEIP and Insights, VMware and Pivotal collect technical information about your
organization’s use of the Pivotal Container Service (“PKS”) on a regular basis.
Since PKS is jointly developed and sold by VMware and Pivotal, we will share this information with one
another.
Information collected under CEIP or Insights does not personally identify any individual.

Regardless of your selection in the **Usage Data** pane, a small amount of data is sent from Cloud Foundry Container Runtime (CFCR) to the PKS tile. However, that data is not shared externally. 

To configure the **Usage Data** pane:

1. Select the **Usage Data** side-tab.
1. Read the Usage Data description.
1. Make your selection.
  1. To join the program, select **Yes, I want to join the CEIP and Insights Program for PKS**.
  1. To decline joining the program, select **No, I do not want to join the CEIP and Insights Program for PKS**.
1. Click **Save**.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> 
  If you choose to join the CEIP and Insights Program for PKS, open your firewall to allow outgoing access on port 443 to the following URL: https://vcsa.vmware.com/ph-prd.
</p>


###<a id='plans'></a> Plans

To activate a plan, perform the following steps:

1. Click the **Plan 1**, **Plan 2**, or **Plan 3** tab.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: A plan defines a set of resource types used for deploying clusters. You can configure up to three plans. You must configure <strong>Plan 1</strong>.</p>
1. Select **Active** to activate the plan and make it available to developers deploying clusters.
  ![Plan pane configuration](images/plan1.png)
1. Under **Name**, provide a unique name for the plan.
1. Under **Description**, edit the description as needed.
The plan description appears in the Services Marketplace, which developers can access by using PKS CLI.
1. Under **Master/ETCD Node Instances**, select the default number of Kubernetes master/etcd nodes to provision for each cluster. You can enter either 1 or 3. Set this value to 3 for increased master node availability.
  <p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING</strong>: To change the number of master/etcd nodes, you must ensure that no existing clusters use this plan. PKS does not support changing the number of master/etcd nodes for plans with existing clusters.
  </p>
<%= partial 'beta-component' %>
1. Under **Master/ETCD VM Type**, select the type of VM to use for Kubernetes master/etcd nodes.
1. Under **Master Persistent Disk Type**, select the size of the persistent disk for the Kubernetes master node VM.
1. Under **Master/ETCD Availability Zones**, select one or more AZs for the Kubernetes clusters deployed by PKS. If you select more than one AZ, PKS deploys the master VM in the first AZ and the worker VMs across the remaining AZs.
1. Under **Worker Node Instances**, select the default number of Kubernetes worker nodes to provision for each cluster. For high availability, we recommend creating clusters with at least 3 worker nodes.
  ![Plan pane configuration](images/plan2.png)
1. Under **Worker VM Type**, select the type of VM to use for Kubernetes worker node VMs.
1. Under **Worker Persistent Disk Type**, select the size of the persistent disk for the Kubernetes worker node VMs.
1. Under **Worker Availability Zones**, select one or more AZs for the Kubernetes worker nodes. PKS deploys worker nodes equally across the AZs you select.
1. Under **Errand VM Type**, select the size of the VM that contains the errand. The smallest instance possible is sufficient, as the only errand running on this VM is the one that applies the **Default Cluster App** YAML configuration.
1. (Optional) Under **(Optional) Add-ons - Use with caution**, enter additional YAML configuration to add custom workloads to each cluster in this plan. You can specify multiple files using `---` as a separator. For more information, see [Add Custom Workloads](custom-workloads.html).
  ![Plan pane configuration](images/plan3.png)
1. (Optional) To allow users to create pods with privileged containers, select the **Enable Privileged Containers - Use with caution** option. For more information, see [Pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod/#privileged-mode-for-pod-containers) in the Kubernetes documentation.
1. (Optional) To disable the admission controller, select the **Disable DenyEscalatingExec** checkbox. If you select this option, clusters in this plan can create security vulnerabilities that may impact other tiles. Use this feature with caution.
1. Click **Save**.

To deactivate a plan, perform the following steps:

1. Click the **Plan 1**, **Plan 2**, or **Plan 3** tab.
1. Select **Plan Inactive**.
1. Click **Save**.

###<a id='cloud-provider'></a> Kubernetes Cloud Provider

To configure your Kubernetes cloud provider settings, follow the procedure for your cloud provider.

1. Click **Kubernetes Cloud Provider**.
1. Under **Choose your IaaS**, select either **vSphere** or **GCP**.
1. Follow the procedures for your cloud provider below.

####<a id='vsphere-cloud'></a> vSphere

In the procedure below, you use credentials for vCenter master VMs.
You must have provisioned the service account with the correct permissions.
For more information, see [Create the Master Node Service Account](vsphere-prepare-env.html#create-master).

Ensure the values in the following procedure match those in the **vCenter Config** section of the **Ops Manager** tile.

1. Enter your **vCenter Master Credentials**. See [Preparing to Deploy PKS on vSphere](vsphere-prepare-env.html#create-master) for more information.
  ![vSphere pane configuration](images/cloud-vsphere.png)
1. Enter your **vCenter Host**. For example: `vcenter.CF-EXAMPLE.com`.
1. Enter your **Datacenter Name**. For example: `CF-EXAMPLE-dc`.
1. Enter your **Datastore Name**. For example: `CF-EXAMPLE-ds`.
1. Enter the **Stored VM Folder** so that the persistent stores know where to find the VMs. To retrieve the name of the folder, navigate to your Ops Manager Director tile, click **vCenter Config**, and locate the value for **VM Folder**. The default folder name is `pcf_vms`.
1. Click **Save**.

####<a id='gcp-cloud'></a> GCP

Ensure the values in the following procedure match those in the **Google Config** section of the **Ops Manager** tile.

1. Enter your **GCP Project Id**, which is the name of the deployment in your Ops Manager environment.
1. Enter your **VPC Network**, which is the VPC network name for your Ops Manager environment.
1. Enter your **GCP Master Service Account ID**. This is the email address associated with the master node service account. For information about configuring this account, see [Create the Master Node Service Account](gcp-prepare-env.html#create-master).
1. Enter your **GCP Worker Service Account ID**. This is the email address associated with the worker node service account. For information about configuring this account, see [Create the Worker Node Service Account](gcp-prepare-env.html#create-worker).
1. Click **Save**.

###<a id='syslog'></a> (Optional) Logging

You can designate an external syslog endpoint for PKS component and cluster log messages.

To specify the destination for PKS log messages, do the following:

1. Click **Logging**.
1. To enable syslog forwarding, select **Yes**.
  ![Enable syslog forwarding](images/logging.png)
1. Under **Address**, enter the destination syslog endpoint.
1. Under **Port**, enter the destination syslog port.
1. Select a transport protocol for log forwarding.
1. (Optional) Pivotal strongly recommends that you enable TLS encryption when forwarding logs as they may contain sensitive information. For example, these logs may contain cloud provider credentials. To enable TLS, perform the following steps:
  1. Under **Permitter Peer**, provide the accepted fingerprint (SHA1) or name of remote peer. For example, `*.YOUR-LOGGING-SYSTEM.com`.
  1. Under **TLS Certificate**, provide a TLS certificate for the destination syslog endpoint.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: You do not need to provide a new certificate if the TLS certificate for the destination syslog endpoint is signed by a Certificate Authority (CA) in your BOSH certificate store.
  </p>
1. Follow the procedure for your cloud provider:
  * If you are installing PKS on GCP, click **Save** and continue to the next section.
  * If you are installing PKS on vSphere, you can manage logs using [VMware vRealize Log Insight (vRLI)](https://www.vmware.com/products/vrealize-log-insight.html). The integration pulls logs from all BOSH jobs and containers running in the cluster (node logs from core Kubernetes & BOSH processes, Kubernetst event logs, as well as POD std out and std err). 
  <br/>
    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Before you configure the vRLI integration, you must have a vRLI license and vRLI must be installed, running, and available in your environment. You need to provide the live instance address during configuration. For instructions and additional information, see the [vRealize Log Insight documentation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/vRealize-Log-Insight/index.html).
    </p>
    By default, vRLI logging is disabled. To enable and configure vRLI logging, perform the following steps:
      1. Under **Enable VMware vRealize Log Insight Integration?**, select **Yes**.
      ![Enable VMware vRealize Log Insight Integration](images/logging-vrli.png)
      1. Under **Host**, enter the IP address or FQDN of the vRLI host.
      1. (Optional) Select the **Enable SSL?** checkbox to encrypt the logs being sent to vRLI using SSL. 
      1. (Optional) To skip certificate validation for the vRLI host, select the **Disable SSL certificate validation** checkbox. Disable this if you are using a self-signed certificate in order to simplify setup for a development or test environment.
      <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Disabling certificate validation is not recommended for production environments.
      </p>
      1. If you are not disabling SSL verification _and_ the vRLI cert is signed by a Certificate Authority that has _not_ been configured as a trusted CA root or other well known certificate, then specify it here. Locate the PEM of the CA used to sign the vRLI certificate, copy the contents of the certificate file and then paste them into the **CA certificate** field. Certificates must be in PEM-encoded format.
      1. Under **Rate limiting**, enter the minimum time (in milliseconds) to change the rate at which logs are sent to the vRLI host. The default value (0) means the rate is not limited, which suffices for many deployments. You might want to increase this if your deployment is generating a high volume of logs and you want to limit network traffic. This specifies the minimum time between messages before the fluentd agent begins to drop messages, so consider starting with a lower number (say 10) and tuning to optimize for your deployment. A large number might result in dropping too many log entries.   
      1. Click **Save**. This configuration applies to any clusters created _after_ you have saved these configuration settings and applied changes.
      <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The PKS Tile does not validate your vRLI configuration settings. To verify your setup, look for log entries in vRLi.
      </p>

###<a id='networking'></a> Networking

To configure networking, do the following:

1. Click **Networking**.
1. Under **Container Networking Interface**, select **Flannel**.
  ![Networking pane configuration](images/networking-flannel.png)
1. (Optional) If you are installing PKS on vSphere, do the following to configure a global proxy for all outgoing HTTP/HTTPS traffic from your Kubernetes clusters:
  1. Under **HTTP/HTTPS proxy**, select **Enabled**.
    ![Networking pane configuration](images/networking-https-proxy.png)
  1. Under **HTTP Proxy URL**, enter the URL of your HTTP/HTTPS proxy endpoint. For example, `http://myproxy.com:1234`.
  1. (Optional) If your proxy uses basic authentication, enter the username and password under **HTTP Proxy Credentials**.
  1. Under **No Proxy**, enter the service network CIDR where your PKS cluster is deployed. List any additional IP addresses that should bypass the proxy.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: By default, the <code>.internal</code>, <code>10.100.0.0/8</code>, and <code>10.200.0.0/8</code> IP address ranges are not proxied. This allows internal PKS communication.</p>
1. (Optional) For GCP, if you do not use a NAT instance, enable **Allow outbound internet access from Kubernetes cluster vms (IaaS-dependent)**. Enabling this functionality assigns external IP addresses to VMs in clusters. This setting is ignored in vSphere deployments.
1. Click **Save**.

###<a id='uaa'></a> UAA

To configure the UAA server, do the following:

1. Click **UAA**.
1. Under **PKS CLI Access Token Lifetime**, enter a time in seconds for the PKS CLI access token lifetime.
  ![UAA pane configuration](images/uaa.png)
1. Under **PKS CLI Refresh Token Lifetime**, enter a time in seconds for the PKS CLI refresh token lifetime.
1. Select one of the following options:
  * To use an internal user account store for UAA, select **Internal UAA**. Click **Save** and continue to [(Optional) Monitoring](#monitoring).
  * To use an external user account store for UAA, select **LDAP Server** and continue to [Configure LDAP as an Identity Provider](#configure-ldap).

#### <a id="configure-ldap"></a>Configure LDAP as an Identity Provider

To integrate UAA with one or more LDAP servers, configure PKS with your LDAP endpoint information as follows:

1. Under **UAA**, select **LDAP Server**.<br>
  ![LDAP Server configuration pane](images/ldap1.png)

1. For **Server URL**, enter the URLs that point to your LDAP server.
If you have multiple LDAP servers, separate their URLs with spaces.
Each URL must include one of the following protocols:
    * `ldap://`: Use this protocol if your LDAP server uses an unencrypted connection.
    * `ldaps://`: Use this protocol if your LDAP server uses SSL for an encrypted connection.
To support an encrypted connection, the LDAP server must hold a trusted certificate or you must import a trusted certificate to the JVM truststore.

1. For **LDAP Credentials**, enter the LDAP Distinguished Name (DN) and password for binding to the LDAP server.
For example, `cn=administrator,ou=Users,dc=example,dc=com`.
If the bind user belongs to a different search base, you must use the full DN.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: We recommend that you provide LDAP credentials that grant read-only permissions on the LDAP search base and the LDAP group search base.</p>

1. For **User Search Base**, enter the location in the LDAP directory tree where LDAP user search begins.
The LDAP search base typically matches your domain name.
<br><br>
For example, a domain named `cloud.example.com` may use `ou=Users,dc=example,dc=com` as its LDAP user search base.

1. For **User Search Filter**, enter a string to use for LDAP user search criteria.
The search criteria allows LDAP to perform more effective and efficient searches.
For example, the standard LDAP search filter `cn=Smith` returns all objects with a common name equal to `Smith`.
<br><br>
In the LDAP search filter string that you use to configure PKS, use `{0}` instead of the username.
For example, use `cn={0}` to return all LDAP objects with the same common name as the username.
<br><br>
In addition to `cn`, other common attributes are `mail`, `uid` and, in the case of Active Directory, `sAMAccountName`.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: For information about testing and troubleshooting your LDAP search filters, see the [Configuring LDAP Integration with Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://discuss.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204140418-Configuring-LDAP-Integration-with-Pivotal-Cloud-Foundry-) Knowledge Base article.</p>

1. For **Group Search Base**, enter the location in the LDAP directory tree where the LDAP group search begins.
<br><br>
For example, a domain named `cloud.example.com` may use `ou=Groups,dc=example,dc=com` as its LDAP group search base.
<br><br>
Follow the instructions in the [Grant Cluster Access to an External LDAP Group](manage-users.html#external-group) section 
of _Creating and Managing Users with the UAA CLI (UAAC)_ to map the 
groups under this search base to roles in PKS.

1. For **Group Search Filter**, enter a string that defines LDAP group search 
criteria. The standard value is `member={0}`.

1. For **Server SSL Cert**, paste in the root certificate from your CA 
certificate or your self-signed certificate.<br>
  ![LDAP Server configuration pane](images/ldap2.png)

1. For **Server SSL Cert AltName**, do one of the following:
  * If you are using `ldaps://` with a self-signed certificate, enter a Subject 
Alternative Name (SAN) for your certificate. 
  * If you are not using `ldaps://` with a self-signed certificate, leave this field blank.

1. For **First Name Attribute**, enter the attribute name in your LDAP directory that contains user first names.
For example, `cn`.

1. For **Last Name Attribute**, enter the attribute name in your LDAP directory that contains user last names. 
For example, `sn`.

1. For **Email Attribute**, enter the attribute name in your LDAP directory that contains user email addresses.
For example, `mail`.

1. For **Email Domain(s)**, enter a comma-separated list of the email domains 
for external users who can receive invitations to Apps Manager.

1. For **LDAP Referrals**, choose how UAA handles LDAP server referrals to other user stores.
UAA can follow the external referrals, ignore them without returning errors, or generate an error for each external referral and abort the authentication.

1. Click **Save**.

###<a id='monitoring'></a> (Optional) Monitoring

You can monitor Kubernetes clusters and pods metrics externally using the integration with [Wavefront by VMware](https://www.wavefront.com/).
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Before you configure the Wavefront integration, you must have an active Wavefront account and access to a Wavefront instance. You provide your Wavefront access token during configuration. For instructions and additional information, see the [Wavefront documentation](https://docs.wavefront.com/).</p>

By default, monitoring is disabled. To enable and configure Wavefront monitoring, do the following:

1. Under **Wavefront Integration**, select **Yes**.<br>
  ![Monitoring pane configuration](images/monitoring.png)
1. Under **Wavefront URL**, enter the URL of your Wavefront subscription. For example, `https://try.wavefront.com/api`.
1. Under **Wavefront Access Token**, enter the API token for your Wavefront subscription.
1. To configure Wavefront to send alerts by email, enter email addresses or Wavefront Target IDs separated by commas under **Wavefront Alert Recipient**. For example: `user@example.com,Wavefront_TargetID`. You also need to enable errands on order to create alerts. 
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: You also need to enable errands in order to create alerts. Go to the **Errands** tab to enable the **Create pre-defined Wavefront alerts errand** and **Delete pre-defined Wavefront alerts errand**.</p>
1. Click **Save**. Your settings here apply to any clusters created *after* you have saved these configuration settings and applied changes.
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The PKS Tile does not validate your Wavefront configuration settings. To verify your setup, look for cluster and pod metrics in Wavefront.</p>

###<a id='errands'></a> Errands

Errands are scripts that run at designated points during an installation. 

To configure when post-deploy and pre-delete errands for PKS are run, make a selection in the dropdown next to the errand. For a typical PKS deployment, we recommend that you leave the default settings.

  ![Errand configuration pane](images/errands.png)

For more information about errands and their configuration state, see [Managing Errands in Ops Manager](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/managing_errands.html).

<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING</strong>: Because PKS uses floating stemcells, updating the PKS tile with a new stemcell triggers the rolling of every VM in each cluster. Also, updating other product tiles in your deployment with a new stemcell causes the PKS tile to roll VMs. This rolling is enabled by the <strong>Upgrade all clusters errand</strong>. We recommend that you keep this errand turned on because automatic rolling of VMs ensures that all deployed cluster VMs are patched. However, automatic rolling can cause downtime in your deployment.</p>

###<a id='resource-config'></a> Resource Config

To modify the resource usage of PKS, click **Resource Config** and edit the **Pivotal Container Service** job.
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you experience timeouts or slowness when interacting with the PKS API, select a <strong>VM Type</strong> with greater CPU and memory resources for the <strong>Pivotal Container Service</strong> job.</p>

If you are using GCP, enter a name for your PKS API load balancer that begins with `tcp:` in the **Load Balancers** column.
For example, `tcp:pks-api`, where `pks-api` is the name that you configured in Step 6 of [Configuring a GCP Load Balancer](gcp-api-load-balancer.html#create-lb).
For more information, see [Configuring a GCP Load Balancer for the PKS API](gcp-api-load-balancer.html).

##<a id='apply-changes'></a> Step 3: Apply Changes

After configuring the tile, return to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Apply Changes** to deploy the tile.

##<a id='retrieve-pks-api'></a> Step 4: Retrieve PKS API Endpoint

You must share the PKS API endpoint to allow your organization to use the API to create, update, and delete clusters.
See [Create a Cluster](create-cluster.html) for more information.

To retrieve the PKS API endpoint, do the following:

1. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard. 
1. Click the Pivotal Container Service tile.
1. Click the **Status** tab and locate the **Pivotal Container Service** job. The IP address of the Pivotal Container Service job is the PKS API endpoint.

##<a id='loadbalancer-pks-api'></a> Step 5: Configure External Load Balancer

If you are using GCP, continue to [Next Steps](#next-steps).

If you are using vSphere, configure an external load balancer to access the PKS API from outside the network.
You can use any external load balancer of your choice.

Your external load balancer forwards traffic to the PKS API endpoint on ports 9021 and 8443.
Configure the external load balancer to resolve to the domain name you set in the [PKS API](#pks-api) section of the tile configuration.

The load balancer should be configured with:

- The IP address from [Step 4: Retrieve PKS API Endpoint](#retrieve-pks-api)
- Ports 8443 and 9021
- The HTTPS or TCP protocol

##<a id='next-steps'></a> Next Steps 

Configure authentication for PKS using either User Account and Authentication (UAA) or enterprise single sign-on (SSO).

* To create and manage users using UAA, see [Manage Users in UAA](manage-users.html).
* To set up SSO configuration with Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML), see [Configure Authentication and Enterprise SSO](configure-sso.html).

After configuring authentication, follow the procedures in [Configure PKS API Access](configure-api.html) to enable operators to create and manage clusters.
