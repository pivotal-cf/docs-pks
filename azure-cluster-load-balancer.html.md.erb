title: Creating and Configuring an Azure Load Balancer for Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition Clusters
owner: TKGI
---

This topic describes how to create and configure an Azure load balancer for your <%= vars.product_full %> cluster.
Using an Azure load balancer is optional, but you may want to add one to your Kubernetes cluster to
manage the cluster using the <%= vars.control_plane %> and Kubernetes CLI (kubectl).

A load balancer is a third-party device that distributes network and application traffic across
resources.
You can use a load balancer to secure and facilitate access to a <%= vars.product_short %> cluster from outside the
network. Using a load balancer can also prevent individual network components from being overloaded
by high traffic.

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> If your Kubernetes control plane node VMs are recreated for any
reason, you must reconfigure your cluster load balancers to point to the new control plane VMs. For
instructions, see <a href="#reconfigure">Reconfigure Load Balancer</a>.</p>

##<a id='prerequisites'></a> Prerequisites

To complete the steps below, you must identify the <%= vars.control_plane %> VM. You can find
the name in the following ways:

* In the [Azure Dashboard](https://portal.azure.com), locate the VM tagged with
`instance_group:pivotal-container-service`.
* On the command line, run `bosh vms`.

## <a id='define-lb'></a>Create and Configure a Load Balancer

Follow the steps below to create and configure an Azure load balancer for your <%= vars.product_short %> cluster.

###<a id='create-load-balancer'></a> Create Load Balancer

1. In a browser, navigate to the [Azure Dashboard](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Open the **Load Balancers** service.
1. Click **Add**.

  1. **Name**: Name the load balancer.
  1. **Type**: Select **Public**.
  1. **SKU**: Select **Standard**.
  1. **Public IP address**: Select **Create new** and name the new IP address.
  1. **Availability zone**: Select an availability zone or **Zone-redundant**.
  1. **Subscription**: Select the subscription which has <%= vars.product_short %> deployed.
  1. **Resource group**: Select the resource group which has <%= vars.product_short %> deployed.
  1. **Location**: Select the location group which has <%= vars.product_short %> deployed.
1. Click **Create**.

###<a id='create-backend-pool'></a> Create Backend Pool

1. From the Azure Dashboard, open the **Load Balancers** service.
1. Click the name of the load balancer that you created in [Create Load Balancer](#create).
1. On your load balancer page, locate and record the IP address of your load balancer.
1. In the **Settings** menu, select **Backend pools**.
1. On the **Backend pools** page, click **Add**.
1. On the **Add backend pool** page, complete the form as follows:
  1. **Name**: Name the backend pool.
  1. **Virtual network**: Select the virtual network where the <%= vars.control_plane %> VM is deployed.
  1. **Virtual machine**: Select all of the control plane VMs for your cluster. For information about
    identifying the control plane VM IDs, see
    [Identify Kubernetes Cluster Control Plane VMs](create-cluster.html#master-id) in _Creating Clusters_.
1. Click **Add**.

###<a id='create-health-probes'></a> Create Health Probe

1. From the Azure Dashboard, open the **Load Balancers** service.
1. In the **Settings** menu, select **Health probes**.
1. On the **Health probes** page, click **Add**.
1. On the **Add health probe** page, complete the form as follows:
  1. **Name**: Name the health probe.
  1. **Protocol**: Select **TCP**.
  1. **Port**: Enter `8443`.
  1. **Interval**: Enter the interval of time to wait between probe attempts.
  1. **Unhealthy Threshold**: Enter a number of consecutive probe failures that must occur before
    a VM is considered unhealthy.
1. Click **OK**.

###<a id='create-health-probes'></a> Create Load Balancing Rule

1. From the Azure Dashboard, open the **Load Balancers** service.
1. In the **Settings** menu, select **Load Balancing Rules**.
1. On the **Load balancing rules** page, click **Add**.
1. On the **Add load balancing rules** page, complete the form as follows:
  1. **Name**: Name the load balancing rule.
  1. **IP Version**: Select **IPv4**.
  1. **Frontend IP address**: Select the appropriate IP address. Clients communicate with your load
    balancer on the selected IP address and service traffic is routed to the target VM by this NAT
    rule.
  1. **Protocol**: Select **TCP**.
  1. **Port**: Enter `8443`.
  1. **Backend port**: Enter `8443`.
  1. **Backend Pool**: Select the backend pool that you created in
    [Create Backend Pool](#create-backend-pool).
  1. **Health Probe**: Select the health probe that you created in
    [Create Health Probe](#create-health-probes).
  1. **Session persistence**: Select **None**.
1. Click **OK**.

###<a id='create-inbound-rule'></a> Create Inbound Security Rule

1. From the Azure Dashboard, open the **Security Groups** service.
1. Click the name of the Security Group attached to the subnet where the <%= vars.control_plane %> is deployed.  
1. In the **Settings** menu for your security group, select **Inbound security rules**.
1. Click **Add**.
1. On the **Add inbound security rule** page, click **Advanced** and complete the form as follows:
  1. **Name**: Name the inbound security rule.
  1. **Source**: Select **Any**.
  1. **Source port range**: Enter `*`.
  1. **Destination**: Select **Any**.
  1. **Destination port range**: Enter `8443`.
1. Click **OK**.

###<a id='verify'></a> Verify Hostname Resolution

Verify that the **External hostname** used when creating a Kubernetes cluster resolves to the IP
address of the load balancer.

For more information, see [Create a Kubernetes Cluster](create-cluster.html#create) in
_Creating Clusters_.

## <a id="reconfigure"></a>Reconfigure Load Balancer

If your Kubernetes control plane node VMs are recreated for any reason, you must reconfigure your cluster
load balancers to point to the new control plane VMs.
For example, after a stemcell upgrade, BOSH recreates the VMs in your deployment.

To reconfigure your Azure cluster load balancer to use the new control plane VMs, do the following:

1. Identify the VM IDs of the new control plane node VMs for the cluster. For information about
  identifying the control plane VM IDs, see
  [Identify Kubernetes Cluster Control Plane VMs](create-cluster.html#master-id) in _Creating Clusters_.
1. In a browser, navigate to the [Azure Dashboard](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Open the **Load Balancers** service.
1. Select the load balancer for your cluster.
1. In the **Settings** menu, select **Backend pools**.
1. Update the VMs list with the new control plane VM IDs.
1. Click **Save**.
