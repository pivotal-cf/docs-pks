title: Using Proxies with Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition on VMware NSX

This topic describes how HTTP/HTTPS proxies work in VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition (TKGI) with NSX,
and how to set proxies globally.  

To configure proxy settings specifically for individual TKGI clusters, see [Configure Cluster Proxies](proxies-cluster.html).


##<a id='overview'></a>Overview

If your environment includes HTTP proxies, you can configure Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition with NSX to use these proxies so that Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition-deployed Kubernetes control plane and worker nodes access public Internet services and other internal services through a proxy.

In addition, Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition proxy settings apply to the TKGI API instance.
When an Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition operator creates a Kubernetes cluster, the TKGI API VM behind a proxy is able to manage NSX objects on the standard network.

You can also proxy outgoing HTTP/HTTPS traffic from Ops Manager and the BOSH Director so that all Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition components use the same proxy service.

The following diagram illustrates the network architecture:

To configure a global HTTP proxy for all outgoing HTTP/HTTPS traffic from the Kubernetes cluster nodes and the TKGI API server, perform the following steps:

1. Navigate to Ops Manager and log in.

1. Click the **Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition** tile.

1. Click **Networking**.

1. Under **HTTP/HTTPS proxy**, select **Enabled**. When this option is enabled, you can proxy HTTP traffic, HTTPS traffic, or both.  
<%= partial 'global-proxy' %>
1. Save the changes to the Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition tile.

1. Proceed with any remaining Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition tile configurations and deploy Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition. See <a href="./installing-nsx-t.html">Installing Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition on vSphere with NSX</a>.
