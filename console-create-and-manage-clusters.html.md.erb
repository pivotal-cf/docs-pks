This section describes how to create clusters in the <%= vars.product_full %> Management Console. Cluster creation in the management console involves the following actions:

- Add users and user groups to <%= vars.product_full %>, and assign roles to them so that they can create and manage clusters. For information about user management, see [Identity Management in the Management Console](console-identity-management.html).
- Set resource quotas to limit the amount of compute power and memory that users can consume. For information about quotas, see [Assign Resource Quotas to Users](console-resource-quotas.html).
- Create network profiles, so that you can customize the networking for different types of cluster. For information about network profiles, see [Working with Network Profiles](console-network-profile.html)
- When you have set up users and configured network profiles, you can easily [Create Clusters in the Management Console](console-create-clusters.html), applying network and Kubernetes profiles to the clusters.
- After you create clusters, you can [Monitor and Manage Clusters, Nodes, and Namespaces in the Management Console](console-monitor-manage-clusters.html).

You can create Kubernetes clusters in your <%= vars.product_full %> deployment by using the <%= vars.product_full %> CLI or by using the <%= vars.product_full %> Management Console. For information about using the <%= vars.product_full %> CLI to create clusters, see [Creating Clusters](../create-cluster.html).
