This topic describes the components and integrations you can use to capture Kubernetes workload and worker node logs and metrics on <%= vars.product_full %> (<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>) Linux clusters.  

For information about logging and monitoring Kubernetes clusters, workers and workloads on Windows,
see [Monitoring Windows Worker Clusters and Workers](windows-monitoring.html) or [Logging Windows Worker Clusters and Workers](windows-logging.html).

## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

You can use monitoring components to capture Kubernetes workload and worker node logs and metrics on <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>-provisioned Linux Kubernetes clusters.  

For information about monitoring <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> and
<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>-provisioned cluster VMs on Linux, see
[Monitoring <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> and <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>-Provisioned Clusters](host-monitoring.html).  

To capture Kubernetes workload and worker node logs and metrics:   

* [Configure Monitoring Components and Integrations](#configure)  

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: When running on worker nodes, the monitoring components and integrations are visible to
both <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> admins and cluster users, such as developers.
</p>

## <a id='configure'></a>Configure Monitoring Components and Integrations

To monitor Kubernetes worker nodes and workloads in your
<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> deployment:  

1. Enable one or more supported components and integrations in the **<%= vars.product_tile %>** tile >
**In-Cluster Monitoring**. For more information about supported components and integrations, see [Monitoring Components and Integrations](#integrations) below.  

1. To activate <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> sink resources, Wavefront, or vRealize Operations integration,
follow the instructions in _In-Cluster Monitoring_ for your IaaS:  

    * [Installing <%= vars.product_short %> on vSphere](installing-vsphere.html#cluster-monitoring)  
    * [Installing <%= vars.product_short %> on vSphere with NSX-T](installing-nsx-t.html#cluster-monitoring)  
    * [Installing <%= vars.product_short %> on GCP](installing-gcp.html#cluster-monitoring)  
    * [Installing <%= vars.product_short %> on AWS](installing-aws.html#cluster-monitoring)  
    * [Installing <%= vars.product_short %> on Azure](installing-azure.html#cluster-monitoring)  

1. To configure a monitoring integration:  

    * **Sink Resources**: [Sink Resources](#sinks)  
    * **Wavefront**: 
        * [VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition Integration](https://docs.wavefront.com/tkgi.html)  
        * [Creating and Managing Sink Resources](create-sinks.html)  
    * **VMware vRealize Operations Management Pack for Container Monitoring**:  
        * [cAdvisor](https://github.com/google/cadvisor)  
        * [VMware vRealize Operations Management Pack for Container Monitoring](https://docs.vmware.com/en/Management-Packs-for-vRealize-Operations-Manager/1.4/container-monitoring/GUID-BD6B5510-4A16-412D-B5AD-43F74C300C91.html)

## <a id='sinks'></a> Sink Resources

In <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>, you can deploy log sinks and metric sinks to
monitor your Kubernetes worker nodes and workloads that are running on them.

To deploy a log or a metric sink:

1. Enable sink resources in the **<%= vars.product_tile %>** tile >
**In-Cluster Monitoring**.
You can enable both log and metric sink resources or only one of them.
1. (Optional) Enable Node Exporter on worker nodes by selecting the
**Enable node exporter on workers** check box.
1. Create sink resources. For instructions, see
[Creating and Managing Sink Resources](create-sinks.html).

For more information about sink resources, see:

* Conceptual information: [Sink Architecture in <%= vars.product_short %>](sink-architecture.html)
* Sink resource types, outputs, and identifying strings: [Monitoring Clusters with Log Sinks](monitor-sinks.html)
