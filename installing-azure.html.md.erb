##<a id='prerequisites'></a>Prerequisites

Before performing the procedures in this topic, you must have deployed and configured Ops Manager.
For more information, see [Azure Prerequisites and Resource Requirements](azure-requirements.html).

  <p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING</strong>: When you configure the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile, do not use spaces in any field entries. This includes spaces between characters as well as
  leading and trailing spaces. If you use a space in any field entry, the deployment of <%= vars.product_short %> fails.</p>

###<a id='cloud-provider'></a> Kubernetes Cloud Provider

To configure your Kubernetes cloud provider settings, follow the procedures below:

1. Click **Kubernetes Cloud Provider**.

1. Under **Choose your IaaS**, select **Azure**.

    <img src="images/cloud-azure.png" alt="Azure pane configuration">

1. Under **Azure Cloud Name**, select the identifier of your Azure environment.

1. Enter **Subscription ID**. This is the ID of the Azure subscription that the cluster is deployed in.

1. Enter **Tenant ID**. This is the Azure Active Directory (AAD) tenant ID for the subscription that the cluster is deployed in.

1. Enter **Location**. This is the location of the resource group that the cluster is deployed in.  
 
    1. If you do not already know the valid location value for your resource group, determine it:  
        1. You set the location name in [Step 1: Create Network Resources](https://docs.pivotal.io/ops-manager/2-10/azure/deploy-manual.html#network) 
        in _Deploying Ops Manager on Azure Manually_.  
        1. The location name property is a lower-case string without spaces. 
        For example, if your resource group location is `Central US`, 
        the location name property value is `centralus`. 
        1. To determine the valid location value for your resource group location, list the valid locations:  

            ```
            az account list-locations
            ```

    1. Enter **Location**. 
    Enter the valid location value for your resource group location into the **Location** field.  

1. Enter **Resource Group**. This is the name of the resource group that the cluster is deployed in.

1. Enter **Virtual Network**. This is the name of the virtual network that the cluster is deployed in.

1. Enter **Virtual Network Resource Group**. This is the name of the resource group that the virtual network is deployed in.

1. Enter **Default Security Group**. This is the name of the security group attached to the cluster's subnet.
<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> <%= vars.product_short %> automatically assigns the default security group to each VM when you create a Kubernetes cluster.
However, on Azure this automatic assignment may not occur. For more information, see <a href="release-notes.html#security-group">Azure Default Security Group Is Not Automatically Assigned to Cluster VMs</a> in <em><%= vars.product_short %> Release Notes</em>.</p>

1. Enter **Primary Availability Set**. 
This is the name of the availability set that will be used as the load balancer back end.
<br><br>
	Terraform creates this availability set and its name is `YOUR-ENVIRONMENT-NAME-pks-as`, 
  where `YOUR-ENVIRONMENT-NAME` is the value you provided for `env_name` in the `terraform.tfvars` file. 
  For more information, see 
  [Download Templates and Edit Variables File](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/ops-manager/2-7/azure/prepare-env-terraform.html#download) 
  in _Deploying Ops Manager to Azure Using Terraform_ in the VMware Tanzu documentation. 
  You can also find the name of the availability set by logging in to the Azure console.

1. For **Master Managed Identity**, enter `tkgi-master`. You created the managed identity for the master nodes in
[Create the Master Nodes Managed Identity](azure-managed-identities.html#create-master) in *Creating Managed Identities in Azure for <%= vars.product_short %>*.

1. For **Worker Managed Identity**, enter `tkgi-worker`. You created the managed identity for the worker nodes in
[Create the Worker Nodes Managed Identity](azure-managed-identities.html#create-worker) in *Creating Managed Identities in Azure for <%= vars.product_short %>*.

1. Select **Disable Outbound SNAT** to disable the default outbound SNAT rule for Azure.

1. Click **Save**.

###<a id='networking'></a> Networking

To configure networking, do the following:

1. Click **Networking**.
1. Under **Container Networking Interface**, select **Antrea**.
  <img src="images/networking-antrea.png" alt="Networking pane configuration" width="425">

    Antrea is selected as the default Container Networking Interface (CNI). <%= vars.recommended_by %> recommends that you use Antrea
    as your CNI.  
<br>
    For more information about using Antrea as your CNI, see 
    [About Upgrading from the Flannel CNI to the Antrea CNI](understanding-upgrades.html#cni) 
    in _About <%= vars.product_short %> Upgrades_.

    <p class="note">
    <strong>Note:</strong> The Flannel CNI will be deprecated in <%= vars.product_short %> v1.12.
    <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.12 will continue to support existing Flannel CNI-configured clusters 
    but will not provide Flannel as a CNI option for new clusters.
    </p>
1. (Optional) Enter values for **Kubernetes Pod Network CIDR Range** and **Kubernetes Service Network CIDR Range**.
	* Ensure that the CIDR ranges do not overlap and have sufficient space for your deployed services.
	* Ensure that the CIDR range for the **Kubernetes Pod Network CIDR Range** is large enough to accommodate the expected maximum number of pods.
1. Under **Allow outbound internet access from Kubernetes cluster vms (IaaS-dependent)**, leave the **Enable outbound internet access** checkbox unselected. You must leave this checkbox unselected due to an incompatibility between the public dynamic IPs provided by BOSH and load balancers on Azure.

1. Click **Save**.

To modify the resource configuration of <%= vars.product_short %> and specify your <%= vars.control_plane %> load balancer, follow the steps below:

1. Select **Resource Config**.

1. <%= partial 'resource-config' %>

1. For the **<%= vars.control_plane_db %>** job:
    * Leave the **LOAD BALANCERS** field blank.
    * (Optional) If you do not use a NAT instance, select **INTERNET CONNECTED**. This allows component instances direct access to the internet.
1. For the **<%= vars.control_plane %>** job:
    * Enter the name of your <%= vars.control_plane %> load balancer in the **LOAD BALANCERS** field.
    The name of your <%= vars.control_plane %> load balancer is `YOUR-ENVIRONMENT-NAME-pks-lb`. Replace `YOUR-ENVIRONMENT-NAME` with
    the environment name that you configured during
    [Step 1: Download Templates and Edit Variables File](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/ops-manager/2-7/azure/prepare-env-terraform.html#download) 
    in _Deploying Ops Manager on Azure Using Terraform_. 
    If needed, you can find your environment name in your `terraform.tfstate` file.
    <%= partial 'lb-resource-config' %> * (Optional) If you do not use a NAT instance, select **INTERNET CONNECTED**. This allows component instances direct access to the internet.

## <a id='auth'></a> Step 7: Configure Authentication for <%= vars.product_short %>

Follow the procedures in [Setting Up <%= vars.product_short %> Admin Users on Azure](azure-configure-users.html).

##<a id='next-steps'></a> Next Steps

After installing <%= vars.product_short %> on Azure, you may want to do one or more of the following:

* Create a load balancer for your <%= vars.product_short %> clusters. For more information, see [Creating and Configuring an Azure Load Balancer for <%= vars.product_short %> Clusters](azure-cluster-load-balancer.html).
* Create your first <%= vars.product_short %> cluster. For more information, see [Creating Clusters](create-cluster.html).
