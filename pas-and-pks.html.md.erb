<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

Ops Manager is a web app that you use to deploy and manage
Pivotal Application Service (PAS) and Pivotal Container Service (PKS).
This topic explains why Pivotal recommends using separate installations of
Ops Manager for PAS and PKS.

For more information about deploying PKS, see [Installing PKS](installing.html).

## <a id='security'></a>Security

Ops Manager deploys the PAS and PKS runtime platforms using BOSH.
For security reasons, Pivotal does not recommend deploying both
PAS and PKS using the same Ops Manager instance.
For even stronger security, Pivotal recommends deploying each Ops Manager instance
using a unique cloud provider account.

## <a id='tile-configuration'></a>Tile Configuration and Troubleshooting

Separate installations of Ops Manager allow you to customize
and troubleshoot runtime tiles independently.
You may choose to configure Ops Manager with different settings
for your PAS and PKS deployments.

For example, PKS and many PAS features depend on BOSH DNS.
If you deploy PAS to a separate Ops Manager instance,
you can disable BOSH DNS for troubleshooting purposes.
PAS can run without BOSH DNS, but key features
such as secure service credentials with CredHub, service discovery for container-to-container networking,
and NSX-T integration do not work when BOSH DNS is disabled.

If you deploy PAS and PKS to the same Ops Manager instance,
you cannot disable BOSH DNS without breaking your PKS installation
along with the PAS features that depend on BOSH DNS.
