title: Migrating to Policy API
owner: TKGI

**Prerequisites**

See [Supported Migration Topologies](mp2p-migration-concepts.html#supported-topology) in _Migrating to Policy API - Overview_.

Version Requirements:  

- NSX: v4.0.1  
- Ops Manager: v3.0  
- TKGI: v1.15.0 or later  
- TKGI clusters: v1.15.0 or later  
     

**Migration Setup**

1. Backup your workloads for each cluster
1. Back up NSX
1. To manually enable **NSX Promoter**, the NSX migration service:
    1. Open the NSX UI
    1. Open System > General Settings
    1. Under _Manager to Policy Object Promotion_, select **Start Objects Promotion**.
    Warning: NSX promoter will migrate all MP objects on NSX to Policy. 
    If your NSX is also consumed by other products besides TKGI, please evaluate if you want to migrate all.
1. Create necessary "admin" DFW rules if needed (optional)
1. In the Ops Manager UI:  
    1. Deactivate BOSH resurrection

**Migrate TKGI to the Policy API Topology**

Warning: Do not intentionally run TKGI in mixed mode for long.

1. Migrate a single cluster to the Policy API:  

    ```
    pks promote-cluster-to-policy CLUSTER-NAME
    ```
1. Verify successful cluster migration to the Policy API:  

    ```
    pks cluster CLUSTER-NAME
    ```
1. In the Ops Manager UI:  
    1. Select **Use NSX-T Policy API**.
1. To configure TKGI so newly created cluster use the Policy API:
1. Update TKGI tile to Policy API mode:  
    1. Find the resources Policy ID from NSX UI
    1. Fill in TKGI tile UI with Policy ID.
    1. Select **Policy Mode**.
    1. Select **Apply Changes**.

    Or:
    1. Find the resources Policy ID with NSX API.  
    1. Fill in TKGI properties with Ops Manager CLI.  

1. Migrate each remaining cluster and validate successful migration to the Policy API topology:  

    ```
    pks promote-cluster-to-policy CLUSTER-NAME
    pks cluster CLUSTER-NAME
    ```
Note: Failure domain is ONE cluster!


**After Migrating Clusters to the Policy API Topology**  

1. Manual cleanup:
    1. Remove original MP Network Profiles.
    1. Remove TOP/BOTTOM firewall sections if customers didn't delete them before using NSX promotion
1.  Use NSX promoter to promote leftover NSX resources



**Troubleshooting**

debug/workaround/temporary failure
- re-run `pks promote-cluster`
- If running `promote-cluster` does not fix the cluster, create a new cluster and restore workloads to it

```
kubo@jumper:~$ pks promote-cluster c1​

You are about to promote cluster c1 to NSX Policy. Are you sure you want to continue? (y/n): y​

Error: The cluster c1 is from previous installation, please upgrade cluster before current operation​

kubo@jumper:~$ pks upgrade-cluster c2

You are about to upgrade k8s10-group.
Warning: The runtime will switch to containerd unless you have set the "lock_container_runtime" flag​
Warning: This operation may be long running and may block further operations on the cluster(s) until complete​

Continue? (y/n):y
Error: c2 cannot be upgraded before promoting to Policy successfully when it fails at MIGRATE_CLUSTER.  Please re-run 'tkgi promote-cluster-to-policy' ​

to promote cluster successfully first
