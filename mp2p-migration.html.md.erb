To complete an MP2P Migration in your <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> environment:

1. Before migrating your <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> environment to NSX Policy API, review the warnings and considerations in 
[Migrating the NSX Management Plane API to NSX Policy API - Overview](mp2p-migration-concepts.html).  
1. Confirm your environment meets the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites).  
1. [Prepare for MP2P Migration](#migration-prep).  
1. [Migrate <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Clusters from the NSX Management Plane API to NSX Policy API](#migration-steps).  
1. [Post-Migration Cleanup](#migration-cleanup).  


<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> 
Limit upgrading NSX and <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> to only resolving critical issues while your environment is in MP2P Migration mixed-mode.
</p>

<br>
### <a id="prerequisites"></a> Prerequisites

Before migrating <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> from NSX Management Plane API to NSX Policy API, 
verify your <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> environment meets the following requirements:  

* <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Version Requirements:  
    * <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Tile and CLI: v1.15.1 or later.  
    * <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> clusters: v1.15.1 or later.  

* Environment Version Requirements:  
    * NSX: v4.0.1.1 or later.  
    * NSX environment is a dedicated TKGI environment. 
    For example, an environment without a TAS or other installations in production.  
    * Ops Manager: v2.10.45 or later.  
    * Ops Manager CLI: latest.  

* Cluster Requirements:  

    * <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> MP2P Migration does not support clusters configured with:  

        * NSGroups, including [Bootstrap Security Group](network-profiles-ns-groups.html) 
        and [BOSH VM Extensions](bosh-vm-extensions.html) NSGroup configurations.  
        * The `ncp.nsx_v3.k8s_np_use_ip_sets` Network Profile parameter set to `false`. 
        Before migrating a cluster, you must restore the parameter to `true`, the default value  for NSX Management Plane API. 
        For more information, see [Migrate a <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Cluster to NSX Policy API](#migration-steps-cluster) below.  
        * NSX Policy API Mode resources, such as the `default-balanced-client-ssl-profile`, `default-high-compatibility-client-ssl-profile`, `default-high-security-client-ssl-profile` default ssl profiles. 
        MP2P Migration supports only clusters that reference only NSX Management Plane API resources.  
        
* Other Requirements:  

    * Administrator access to NSX, Ops Manager, BOSH, and TKGI.  
    * For more information about <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> MP2P Migration limitations, see

    Where:  
    
    * `OPSMAN-API` is the IP address for the Ops Manager API.  
    * `USERNAME` is the account to use to run Ops Manager API commands.  
    * `PASSWORD` is the password for the account.  


<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Retain the exported back up for use at the end of <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> MP2P Migration.  
</p>

1. Back up the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> environment, including workloads on all clusters. 
For more information, see [Backing Up and Restoring Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition](backup-and-restore.html).  
1. Back up NSX.  
<% end %>

   
<br>
### <a id="migration-prep-enable"></a> Enable Migration

You must enable support for MP2P Migration in NSX before promoting clusters to NSX Policy API. 
Additionally, Ops Manager and BOSH must be configured to support a mixed environment of NSX Management Plane API and NSX Policy API clusters 
before promoting clusters.  

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: After activating NSX Policy API, 
    existing NSX backups created while using NSX Management Plane API cannot be used to restore your environment or your clusters.
</p>

<br>
To prepare <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> for MP2P Migration:  

1. Disable the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Upgrade All Clusters errand.  


<br>
To prepare NSX for MP2P Migration:  

1. To activate the NSX Migration Coordinator Service on all NSX managers:  

    1. SSH to the NSX Manager with administrative privileges:  
        
    1. At the `nsxmanager>` prompt, run the following:  
    
        ```
        nsxmanager> start service migration-coordinator
        ```

1. If your NSX Manager cluster is configured with VIP, configure the Source IP Persistence Profile for LB or 
use a Source IP LB algorithm during TKGI foundation migration. 
All migration requests should be made on a single NSX Manager.  


<br>
To prepare Ops Manager and BOSH for MP2P Migration:   

1. Download [bosh_migration_mode.sh](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/docs-pks/blob/<%= vars.product_version_raw %>/cli/bosh_migration_mode.sh), 
the BOSH Migration Mode script, from the <%= vars.product_full %> documentation GitHub repository.  

1. Select a virtual machine that is able to reach Ops Manager, 
and can run the [Ops Manager CLI](https://docs.pivotal.io/ops-manager/2-10/install/cli.html), [BOSH CLI](https://bosh.io/docs/cli-v2-install), and [yq CLI](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq).  

1. Copy the the BOSH Migration Mode script to the virtual machine.  

1. Export the `BOSH_CLIENT`, `BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET`, `BOSH_ENVIRONMENT`, and `BOSH_CA_CERT`  
environment variables. For more information, see 
[Set the BOSH Environment Variables on the Ops Manager VM](https://docs.pivotal.io/ops-manager/2-10/install/trouble-advanced.html#export-bosh-envs)

    For example:  
    
    <pre class="terminal">
    export BOSH_CLIENT=ops_manager  BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET=FHoiRmt3qq1LfbPncF4vAyxZWUSpqbZ-  BOSH_ENVIRONMENT=88.0.0.3 bosh  BOSH_CA_CERT=/var/tempest/workspaces/default/root_ca_certificate  
    </pre>
    
1. To activate BOSH Migration Mode run the BOSH Migration Mode script:  

    ```
    ./bosh_migration_mode enable OPSMAN-IP USERNAME PASSWORD 
    ```
    
    Where:  

    * `OPSMAN-IP` is the IP address for the Ops Manager.  
    * `USERNAME` is the account to use to run Ops Manager API commands.  
    * `PASSWORD` is the password for the account.  


<% if vars.product_version == "COMMENTED"  %>
1. Deactivate BOSH Resurrection:  

    * Ops Manager v3.0 and later:  
    
        1. Open the Ops Manager UI.  
        1. Deactivate BOSH Resurrection.

### <a id="migration-prep-top-firewall"></a> Migrate DFW Top Firewall Rules

If your clusters are customized with DFW rules 
or use Network Profiles configured with DFW section markers, 
migrate the DFW rules:  

1. Re-create your existing top section DFW rules from above your NSX Manager `top_firewall_section_marker`
    in the NSX Policy Environment section.  Include the `top_firewall_section_marker` in the new copy. 

    <p class="note warning"><strong>Warning</strong>: 
    If you do not configure your DFW Rules correctly, your workloads will lose network connectivity.
    Both the original copy of the <code>top_firewall_section_marker</code> section and the re-created copy in the NSX Policy Environment section 
    must be in your DFW rules after you complete this step.  
    </p>
    
For more information on configuring DFW rules, 
see [DFW Migration](mp2p-migration-concepts.html#concerns-limitations-dfw)

## <a id="migration-steps"></a> Migrate <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Clusters from the NSX Management Plane API to NSX Policy API

To migrate <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> to NSX Policy API, serially promote all of your <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> clusters individually:  

1. [Migrate a <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Cluster to NSX Policy API](#migration-steps-cluster)  

After migrating all clusters:  

1. [Migrate DFW Bottom Firewall Rules](#migration-steps-bottom-firewall)  


<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> 
Do not intentionally run <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> in mixed mode for an extended period of time. 
Promote all <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> clusters to NSX Policy API as quickly as possible.
</p>  

<br>
### <a id="migration-steps-cluster"></a> Migrate a <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Cluster to NSX Policy API

To migrate an individual cluster from the NSX Management Plane API to NSX Policy API:  

1. If your cluster is custom configured with the `ncp.nsx_v3.k8s_np_use_ip_sets` Network Profile parameter set to `false`,
    restore the default `"ncp.nsx_v3.k8s_np_use_ip_sets": true` configuration by updating the cluster with a modified Network Profile.  

1. Promote the cluster using the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> CLI:  

    ```
    tkgi promote-cluster-to-policy CLUSTER-NAME
    ```
    
    Where `CLUSTER-NAME` is the name of the promoted cluster.  
    
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> 
    Do not attempt to promote an additional <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> cluster to NSX Policy API 
    before completing the promotion of the current clusters.
    </p>  

1. Validate successful migration to NSX Policy API topology for the cluster before upgrading subsequent clusters:  

    ```
    tkgi cluster CLUSTER-NAME
    ```
    
    Where `CLUSTER-NAME` is the name of the promoted cluster.  

For more information on cluster limitations while promoting a cluster,

### <a id="migration-steps-bottom-firewall"></a> Migrate DFW Bottom Firewall Rules

If your clusters are customized with DFW rules 
or use Network Profiles configured with DFW section markers, 
finish migrating the DFW rules:  

1. Re-create your existing bottom section DFW rules from below your NSX Manager `bottom_firewall_section_marker`
 in the NSX Policy Application section BELOW all migrated NCP rules. Include the `bottom_firewall_section_marker`.

1. Remove all of the original NSX Management Plane customer-defined DFW rules. 
When done, there should be only one copy of the top firewall rules, the one in the NSX Policy Environment section, 
and only one copy of the bottom firewall rules, the one in the NSX Policy Application section.  
 
     <p class="note warning"><strong>Warning</strong>: 
    If you do not configure your DFW Rules correctly, your workloads will lose network connectivity.
    You must remove all NSX Management Plane user-defined DFW rules 
    before starting post-migration cleanup.
    </p>

## <a id="migration-cleanup"></a> Post-Migration Cleanup  

After all <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> clusters have been promoted to NSX Policy API, 
remaining NSX resources must be promoted 
and the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> configurations for NSX Management Plane API objects should be removed.  

To clean up after promoting all clusters:  

1. Remove NSX Management Plane API-related configurations:  

    1. Remove the original NSX Management Plane API-configured Network Profiles.  

1.  Use the NSX Promoter to promote the remaining NSX resources:  
    
    1. Log in to the NSX Web UI using an account with with admin privileges.  
    1. Go to the **NSX** > **System** > **General Settings**.  
    1. Select **Start Objects Promotion**.  
    
        The following are reconfigured by the NSX Promoter:  

        <% if vars.product_version == "v1.15"  %>
        * Deployment network and router.  
        <% else %> 
        * Deployment network and router.  (<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.15.1 release only.) 
        <% end %> 
        * NSX resources in <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> tile **Resource Config**.  
        * NSX resources in cluster `vm_extension` configurations.  
        * Custom infra-level resources out of <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> scope. For example, NAT, IP allocations, subnet allocations, 
    and the load balancers that you have created.  

    For information about the NSX Promoter, see 
    [Promote Manager Objects to Policy Objects](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center/3.2/administration/GUID-3B619DC3-CB6B-4121-810E-B2DD46A49B0B.html).  

1. (Optional) To deactivate the NSX Migration Coordinator Service on all NSX managers:  

    1. SSH to the NSX Manager with administrative privileges.  
 
    1. At the `nsxmanager>` prompt, run the following:  
    
        ```
        nsxmanager> stop service migration-coordinator
        ```

1. If your NSX Manager cluster was configured with VIP before you started MP2P Migration, restore your VIP configuration.  

1. To switch BOSH to Policy API mode:  
    1. Access the virtual machine where you ran the BOSH Migration Mode script when you prepared Ops Manager and BOSH for MP2P Migration.  

    1. Export the `BOSH_CLIENT`, `BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET`, `BOSH_ENVIRONMENT`, and `BOSH_CA_CERT` 
        environment variables. For more information, see 
        [Set the BOSH Environment Variables on the Ops Manager VM](https://docs.pivotal.io/ops-manager/2-10/install/trouble-advanced.html#export-bosh-envs) 
        in _Advanced Troubleshooting with the BOSH CLI_.  

        For example:  

        <pre class="terminal">
            export BOSH_CLIENT=ops_manager  BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET=FHoiRmt3qq1LfbPncF4vAyxZWUSpqbZ-  BOSH_ENVIRONMENT=88.0.0.3 bosh  BOSH_CA_CERT=/var/tempest/workspaces/default/root_ca_certificate  
            </pre>

    1. Run the following BOSH Migration Mode script command:  

        ```
        ./bosh_migration_mode disable OPSMAN-IP USERNAME PASSWORD
        ```  

        Where:  

        * `OPSMAN-IP` is the IP address for the Ops Manager.  
        * `USERNAME` is the account to use to run Ops Manager API commands.  
        * `PASSWORD` is the password for the account.

## <a id="troubleshooting"></a> Troubleshooting


debug/workaround/temporary failure
- re-run `pks promote-cluster`
- If running `promote-cluster` does not fix the cluster, create a new cluster and restore workloads to it

```
kubo@jumper:~$ pks promote-cluster c1

You are about to promote cluster c1 to NSX Policy. Are you sure you want to continue? (y/n): y

Error: The cluster c1 is from previous installation, please upgrade cluster before current operation

kubo@jumper:~$ pks upgrade-cluster c2

You are about to upgrade k8s10-group.
Warning: The runtime will switch to containerd unless you have set the "lock_container_runtime" flag
Warning: This operation may be long running and may block further operations on the cluster(s) until complete

Continue? (y/n):y
Error: c2 cannot be upgraded before promoting to Policy successfully when it fails at MIGRATE_CLUSTER.  
Please re-run 'tkgi promote-cluster-to-policy' to promote cluster successfully first.
