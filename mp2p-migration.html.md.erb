You must enable support for MP2P Migration in NSX before promoting clusters to NSX Policy API. 
Additionally, Ops Manager and BOSH must be configured to support a mixed environment of NSX Management Plane API and NSX Policy API clusters 
before promoting clusters.  

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: After activating NSX Policy API, 
    existing NSX backups created while using NSX Management Plane API cannot be used to restore your environment or your clusters.
</p>

<br>
To prepare <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> for MP2P Migration:  

1. Disable the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Upgrade All Clusters errand.

### <a id="migration-prep-top-firewall"></a> Migrate DFW Top Firewall Rules

If your clusters are customized with DFW rules 
or use Network Profiles configured with DFW section markers, 
migrate the DFW rules:  

1. Copy your existing top section DFW rules from above your NSX Manager `top_firewall_section_marker`
 to the NSX Policy Environment section.  Include the `top_firewall_section_marker`. 
 
Two copies of the `top_firewall_section_marker` section should be in your DFW rules after you complete this step.  
<% if vars.product_version == "COMMENTED"  %>
1. Move your existing high priority DFW rules from your NSX Manager section
 to the NSX Policy Environment section.
    Note: "<i>High Priority</i>" means the sections above and includes top_firewall_section_marker  
<% end %>

<br>
<br>
## <a id="migration-steps"></a> Migrate <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Clusters from the NSX Management Plane API to NSX Policy API

To migrate <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> to NSX Policy API, serially promote all of your <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> clusters individually.  

For more information on cluster limitations while promoting a cluster, 
see [During Cluster Promotion to NSX Policy API](mp2p-migration-concepts.html#concerns-limitations) 
in _Migrating the NSX Management Plane API to NSX Policy API - Overview_.  

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> 
Do not intentionally run <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> in mixed mode for an extended period of time. 
Promote all <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> clusters to NSX Policy API as quickly as possible.
</p>  

To migrate an individual cluster:  

1. Promote the cluster using the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> CLI:  

    ```
    tkgi promote-cluster-to-policy CLUSTER-NAME
    ```
    
    Where `CLUSTER-NAME` is the name of the promoted cluster.  
    
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> 
    Do not attempt to promote an additional <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> cluster to NSX Policy API 
    before completing the promotion of the current clusters.
    </p>  
<% if vars.product_version == "COMMENTED"  %>

1. (Optional) To migrate the cluster's "Admin" DFW rules to NSX Policy API:  

    1. For each DFW rule, complete the steps in 
    [Dealing with DFW Sections Created by NSX Admin](https://docs-staging.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-Container-Plugin/4.0/ncp-kubernetes/GUID-42003875-1127-45F2-BC26-A201B5E5245B.html).  
<% end %>

1. Validate successful migration to NSX Policy API topology for the cluster before upgrading subsequent clusters:  

    ```
    tkgi cluster CLUSTER-NAME
    ```
    
    Where `CLUSTER-NAME` is the name of the promoted cluster.  

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> 
Do not attempt to promote an additional <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> cluster to NSX Policy API 
before completing the promotion of the current clusters.
</p>  


<br>
### <a id="migration-post-bottom-firewall"></a> Migrate DFW Bottom Firewall Rules

If your clusters are customized with DFW rules 
or use Network Profiles configured with DFW section markers, 
migrate the DFW rules:  

1. Move your existing bottom section DFW rules from below your NSX Manager `bottom_firewall_section_marker`
 to the NSX Policy Application section BELOW all migrated NCP rules. Include the `bottom_firewall_section_marker`.
<% if vars.product_version == "COMMENTED"  %>
1. Move your existing high priority DFW rules from your NSX Manager section
 to the NSX Policy Environment section.
    Note: "<i>High Priority</i>" means the sections above and includes top_firewall_section_marker  
<% end %>
1. Delete the original top firewall rules in the NSX Manager sections. 
When done, there should be one copy of the top firewall rules in the NSX Policy Environment section 
and one copy of the bottom firewall rules in the NSX Policy Application section.  


<br>
<br>
## <a id="migration-cleanup"></a> Post-Migration Cleanup  

After all <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> clusters have been promoted to NSX Policy API, 
remaining NSX resources must be promoted 
and the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> configurations for NSX Management Plane API objects should be removed.  

To clean up after promoting all clusters:  

1. Remove NSX Management Plane API-related configurations:  

    1. Remove the original NSX Management Plane API object configured Network Profiles.  
    1. If you haven't already done so, remove the TOP and BOTTOM firewall sections for all clusters.  
    
        * For each DFW rule, complete the steps in 
        [Dealing with DFW Sections Created by NSX Admin](https://docs-staging.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-Container-Plugin/4.0/ncp-kubernetes/GUID-42003875-1127-45F2-BC26-A201B5E5245B.html).  

1.  Use the NSX Promoter to promote the remaining NSX resources:  

    * Deployment network and router (only 1.15.1 release) 
    * NSX resources in <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> tile **Resource Config**  
    * NSX resources in cluster `vm_extension` configurations
    * Custom infra-level resources out of <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> scope. For example, NAT, IP allocations, subnet allocations, 
    and the load balancers that you have created.  

    For information about the NSX Promoter, see 
    [Promote Manager Objects to Policy Objects](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center/3.2/administration/GUID-3B619DC3-CB6B-4121-810E-B2DD46A49B0B.html).  

1. Migrate BOSH to Policy API mode:  

    * If you have retained the BOSH Director configuration backup:  
    
        ```
        sed -i 's/nsx_t_use_policy_api: false/nsx_t_use_policy_api: true/' before_mp2p_bosh.yml  
        om -t https://OPSMAN-API -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD -k configure-director --config before_mp2p_bosh.yml 
        om -t https://OPSMAN-API -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD -k pending-changes  
        om -t https://OPSMAN-API -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD -k apply-changes -sdp 
        ```
        
        Where:  
        
        * `OPSMAN-API` is the IP address for the Ops Manager API.

- re-run `pks promote-cluster`
- If running `promote-cluster` does not fix the cluster, create a new cluster and restore workloads to it

```
kubo@jumper:~$ pks promote-cluster c1

You are about to promote cluster c1 to NSX Policy. Are you sure you want to continue? (y/n): y

Error: The cluster c1 is from previous installation, please upgrade cluster before current operation

kubo@jumper:~$ pks upgrade-cluster c2

You are about to upgrade k8s10-group.
Warning: The runtime will switch to containerd unless you have set the "lock_container_runtime" flag
Warning: This operation may be long running and may block further operations on the cluster(s) until complete

Continue? (y/n):y
Error: c2 cannot be upgraded before promoting to Policy successfully when it fails at MIGRATE_CLUSTER.  
Please re-run 'tkgi promote-cluster-to-policy' to promote cluster successfully first.
