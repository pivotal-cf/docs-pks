Prepare the vSphere and NSX-T infrastructure for the <%= vars.product_short %> Management Plane where the PKS, Ops Manager, BOSH Director, and Harbor Registry VMs are deployed.

##<a id='prerequisites'></a>Prerequisites

Before you begin this procedure, make sure you have completed the following prerequisites for installing <%= vars.product_short %> on vSphere with NSX-T:

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="./vsphere-nsxt-index-prepare.html">Preparing to Install <%= vars.product_short %> on vSphere with NSX-T Data Center</a>
  </li>

  </li>
</ul>

##<a id='about'></a> About the <%= vars.product_short %> Management Plane

The <%= vars.product_short %> Management Plane is the network for PKS Management Plane components, including the PKS API Server, Ops Manager, BOSH Director, and Harbor Registry. The <%= vars.product_short %> Management Plane includes a vSphere resource pool for Management Plane components, as well as a NSX Tier-1 Logical Switch, Tier-1 Logical Router, and Router Port, and NSX-T NAT rules on the Tier-0 Router.

For all types of <a href="nsxt-topologies.html#topology-nat">NSX-T deployment topologies</a>, create a Tier-1 (T1) Logical Switch and a Tier-1 Logical Router and Port. Enable route advertisement for the T1 Logical Router and advertise All NSX connected routes for the Management Plane VMs. Lastly, link the Tier-1 Router to the Tier-0 Router. 

If you are using the <a href="nsxt-topologies.html#topology-nat">NAT Topology</a>, you will also need to create the following NAT rules on the Tier-0 Router:

* Source NAT (SNAT) rule to allow the PKS Management VMs to communicate with your vCenter and NSX Manager environments. For example, an SNAT rule that maps `172.31.0.0/24` to `10.172.1.1`, where `10.172.1.1` is a routable IP address from your **PKS MANAGEMENT CIDR**.
* Destination NAT (DNAT) rule that maps an external IP address from the **PKS MANAGEMENT CIDR** to the IP where you deploy Ops Manager on the Management Plane logical switch. For example, a DNAT rule that maps `10.172.1.2` to `172.31.0.2`, where `172.31.0.2` is the IP address you assign to Ops Manager when connected to `ls-pks-mgmt`.
* Destination NAT (DNAT) rule that maps an external IP address from the **PKS MANAGEMENT CIDR** to the IP where you deploy Harbor on the Management Plane logical switch. For example, a DNAT rule that maps `10.172.1.3` to `172.31.0.3`, where `172.31.0.3` is the IP address you assign to Harbor when connected to `ls-pks-mgmt`.

Lastly, if you want to provide users with remote access to the PKS CLI, you will need to define a DNAT rule that maps an external IP address from the **PKS MANAGEMENT CIDR** to the IP where you deploy the PKS API Server on the Management Plane logical switch. This rule lets developers use the PKS CLI remotely from their workstations or laptops. Such a rule is needed for both NAT and No-NAT topologies.

  <img src="images/nsxt/mgmt-plane/create-mgmt-plane-15.png">

##<a id='connect-Ts'></a>Step 4. Connect the Tier-1 Router to the Tier-0 Router

Connect the Tier-1 router to the Tier-0 router and verify router-to-router connectivity.

1. At the **Tier-1 Router > Overview** screen, select the option **Tier-0 Connection > Connect**.

1. At the **Connect to Tier-0 Router**, select the Tier-0 Router and click **Connect**.
  <img src="images/nsxt/mgmt-plane/create-mgmt-plane-16.png">

1. Verify connectivity between the Tier-1 and Tier-0 Routers.
  <img src="images/nsxt/mgmt-plane/create-mgmt-plane-17.png">

1. Select the **Tier-1 Router > Configuration > Router ports**.

  The Tier-1 Router created for the Management Plane should have 2 port connections: one connected to the Tier-0 router, and a second port connected to the logical switch defined for the Management Plane. This second port is the default gateway for all VMs connected to this logical switch.

##<a id='snat-mgmt'></a>Step 5. Create SNAT Rule on the Tier-0 Router for vCenter and NSX Manager

Create a Source NAT (SNAT) rule on the Tier-0 Router for <%= vars.product_short %> management components to access vCenter and NSX manager. The SNAT rule on the Tier-0 Router allows the Management Plane VMs to communicate with the vCenter and NSX-T Management environments. For example, create a SNAT rule that maps `172.31.0.0/24` to `10.172.1.1`, where `10.172.1.1` is a routable IP address from your **PKS MANAGEMENT CIDR**.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Limit the Destination CIDR for the SNAT rules to the subnets that contain your vCenter and NSX Manager IP addresses.</p>

1. Select **Tier-0 Router > Services > NAT**.
1. Click ADD and configure the SNAT rule:
   * **Priority**: `1010` (for example)
   * **Action**: `SNAT`
   * **Source**: `10.0.0.0/24` (for example)
   * **Destination IP**: `10.40.206.0/24` (for example)
   * **Translated IP**: `10.40.14.2` (for example)
  <img src="images/nsxt/mgmt-plane/create-mgmt-plane-22.png">

1. Click **Add**.

1. Verify SNAT rule creation.
  <img src="images/nsxt/mgmt-plane/create-mgmt-plane-23.png">  

##<a id='dnat-om'></a>Step 6. Create DNAT Rule on the Tier-0 Router for Ops Manager

Create a DNAT rule on the T0 Router to access the Ops Manager Web UI, which is required to deploy <%= vars.product_short %>.

The Destination NAT (DNAT) rule on the Tier-0 Router maps an external IP address from the **PKS MANAGEMENT CIDR** to the IP where you deploy Ops Manager on the Management Plane logical switch. For example, a DNAT rule that maps `10.172.1.2` to `172.31.0.2`, where `172.31.0.2` is the IP address you assign to Ops Manager when connected to `ls-pks-mgmt`.

To create a DNAT rule for Ops Manager:

1. In the NSX-T Manager interface, select **Routing > Routers**.
1. Select the **T0 Router > Services > NAT**.
  <img src="images/nsxt/mgmt-plane/create-mgmt-plane-19.png">
1. Add and configure a DNAT rule with the routable IP address as the destination and the internal IP address for Ops Manager as the translated IP:
   * **Priority**: `1000` (for example)
   * **Action**: DNAT (for example)
   * **Destination IP**: `10.40.14.1` (for example)
   * **Translated IP**: `10.0.0.2` (for example)
	  <img src="images/nsxt/mgmt-plane/create-mgmt-plane-20.png">
1. Click **Add**.
1. Verify the DNAT rule you defined.
	  <img src="images/nsxt/mgmt-plane/create-mgmt-plane-21.png">

##<a id='dnat-harbor'></a>Step 7. Create DNAT on the Tier-0 Router for Harbor Registry

If you are using VMware Harbor Registry with <%= vars.product_short %>, create a DNAT rule on the Tier-0 router to access the Harbor Web UI. This DNAT rule maps the private Harbor IP address to a routable IP address from the floating IP pool on the <%= vars.product_short %> Management network. 

See <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/vmware-harbor/integrating-pks.html#create-dnat">Create DNAT Rule</a> in the VMware Harbor Registry documentation for instructions.</p>

##<a id='create-dnat-pks'></a>Step 8. Create DNAT Rule on T0 Router for External Access to the PKS CLI

This DNAT rule is optional depending on whether or not you need to provide external access to the PKS CLI. If you do need to provide external access, this rule is needed for both NAT and no-NAT modes.

  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: You cannot create this rule until after <%= vars.product_short %> is installed and the PKS API VM has an IP address.</p>

1. When the <%= vars.product_short %> installation is completed, retrieve the <%= vars.product_short %> endpoint by performing the following steps:
  1. From the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard, click the **<%= vars.product_tile %>** tile.
  1. Click the **Status** tab and record the IP address assigned to the **PKS API** job.
1. Create a DNAT rule on the shared Tier-0 router to map an external IP from the **PKS MANAGEMENT CIDR** to the <%= vars.product_short %> endpoint. For example, a DNAT rule that maps `10.172.1.4` to `172.31.0.4`, where `172.31.0.4` is the <%= vars.product_short %> endpoint IP address on the `ls-pks-mgmt` NSX-T Logical Switch.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Ensure that you have no overlapping NAT rules. If your NAT rules overlap, you cannot reach <%= vars.product_short %> Management Plane from VMs in the vCenter network.</p>
