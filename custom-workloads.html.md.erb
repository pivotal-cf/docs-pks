<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic describes how to add custom workloads to <%= vars.product_full %> clusters.

Custom workloads define what a cluster includes out of the box. For example, you can use custom workloads to configure metrics or logging.

##<a id='create'></a> Create YAML Configuration

Create a YAML configuration for your custom workloads. Consult the following example from the [Kubernetes documentation](https://github.com/kubernetes):

```
apiVersion: apps/v1 # for versions before 1.9.0 use apps/v1beta2
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  replicas: 2 # tells deployment to run 2 pods matching the template
  template: # create pods using pod definition in this template
    metadata:
      # unlike pod-nginx.yaml, the name is not included in the meta data as a unique name is
      # generated from the deployment name
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.7.9
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

##<a id='apply'></a> Apply Custom Workloads

To apply custom Kubernetes workloads to every cluster created on a plan, enter your YAML configuration in the **(Optional) Add-ons - Use with caution** field in the pane for configuring a plan in the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile. 

For more information, see the *Plans* section of the *Installing <%= vars.product_short %>* topic for your IaaS. For example, [Plans](installing-pks-vsphere.html#plans) in *Installing <%= vars.product_short %> on vSphere*.
