title: Creating Sink Resources
owner: PKS
---

This topic describes how to create a sink resource for a Kubernetes cluster
provisioned with <%= vars.product_full %> or for a namespace within a
cluster.

## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

Sink resources enable <%= vars.product_short %> users to collect
logs and metrics. You can create the following types of sink resources:

<%= partial 'sink-resources' %>

## <a id='prerequisites'></a>Prerequisites

Before creating a sink resource, do the following:

* If you want to create a `ClusterLogSink` or `LogSink` resource, ensure that the **Enable Log Sink Resources** checkbox is selected in the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile.
* If you want to create a `ClusterMetricSink` or `MetricSink` resource, ensure that the **Enable Metric Sink Resources** checkbox is selected in the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile.

For more information, see the _Logging_ section of the <%= vars.product_short %> installation topic
for your IaaS:

* [Installing <%= vars.product_short %> on vSphere](installing-pks-vsphere.html#syslog)
* [Installing <%= vars.product_short %> on vSphere with NSX-T Integration](installing-nsx-t.html#syslog)
* [Installing <%= vars.product_short %> on GCP](installing-pks-gcp.html#syslog)
* [Installing <%= vars.product_short %> on AWS](installing-pks-aws.html#syslog)
* [Installing <%= vars.product_short %> on Azure](installing-pks-azure.html#syslog)

### <a name='cli-prereqs'></a> CLI Requirements

To create and manage sink resources, you must install the Kubernetes CLI, <code>kubectl</code>. 

Alternately, to manage `ClusterLogSink` resources with the PKS CLI, you must use PKS CLI v1.3 or later.

For installation instructions, see <a href="installing-kubectl-cli.html">Installing the Kubernetes CLI</a> 
and <a href="installing-pks-cli.html">Installing the PKS CLI</a>.

## <a id='define-resource'></a>Create Sinks

You can create log sinks for clusters and namespaces and metric sinks for clusters.

* If you want to create a `ClusterLogSink`, see
[ClusterLogSink Resources](#define-cluster-sink), below.
* If you want to create a `LogSink`, see
[Log Sink Resources](#define-namespace-sink), below.
* If you want to create a `ClusterMetricSink`, see
[ClusterMetricSink Resources](#define-metric-sink), below.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Log sinks created in <%= vars.product_short %> do not support UDP connections.</p>

### <a id='define-cluster-sink'></a>ClusterLogSink Resources

`ClusterLogSink` resources enable you to capture logs from your clusters.

To create and manage `ClusterLogSink` resources, you can:

* [Create ClusterLogSink Resource with the PKS CLI](#cluster-sink-pks)
* [Create a Syslog ClusterLogSink Resource with YAML and kubectl](#syslog-cluster-sink)
* [Create a Webhook ClusterLogSink Resource with YAML and kubectl](#webhook-cluster-sink)

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: <%= vars.product_short %> requires a secure connection be used 
for log forwarding. To forward logs using an unsecured connection, see 
<a href="#unsecured-sink-configuration">Unsecured LogSink and ClusterLogSink Log Forwarding</a>, below.<br>
</p>

#### <a id='cluster-sink-pks'></a> Create ClusterLogSink Resource with the PKS CLI

To create and apply a log sink to a cluster, run the following command:

```
pks create-sink CLUSTER-NAME \
syslog-tls://YOUR-LOG-DESTINATION:YOUR-LOG-DESTINATION-PORT
```
Where:

* `CLUSTER-NAME` is the name of your cluster.
* `YOUR-LOG-DESTINATION` is the URL or IP address of your log management service.
* `YOUR-LOG-DESTINATION-PORT` is the port number of your log management service.

For example:

<pre class="terminal">
$ pks create-sink my-cluster syslog-tls://example.com:12345
</pre>

If you do not specify a name, the command creates 
a log sink resource in the cluster that shares the same name as the cluster.

To provide a name for the log sink resources in your cluster, run the following command. 

```
pks create-sink CLUSTER-NAME --name YOUR-SINK \
syslog-tls://YOUR-LOG-DESTINATION:YOUR-LOG-DESTINATION-PORT
```
Where:

* `CLUSTER-NAME` is the name of your cluster.
* `YOUR-SINK` is the name of the log sink you want to create.
* `YOUR-LOG-DESTINATION` is the URL or IP address of your log management service.
* `YOUR-LOG-DESTINATION-PORT` is the port number of your log management service.

For example:

<pre class="terminal">
$ pks create-sink my-cluster --name second-sink syslog-tls://example.org:54321
</pre>

Specifying a name is useful if you need to manage multiple log sink resources in your cluster.

#### <a id='syslog-cluster-sink'></a> Create a Syslog ClusterLogSink Resource with YAML and kubectl

A syslog `ClusterLogSink` resource delivers logs using the TCP-based syslog protocol.

To define a syslog `ClusterLogSink` resource with YAML and `kubectl`, perform the following steps:

1. Create a YAML file that specifies your log destination in the following format:
  
    ```
    apiVersion: pksapi.io/v1beta1
    kind: ClusterLogSink
    metadata:
       name: YOUR-SINK-NAME
    spec:
       type: syslog
       host: YOUR-LOG-DESTINATION
       port: YOUR-LOG-DESTINATION-PORT
       enable_tls: true
    ```
  Where:
    * `YOUR-SINK` is a name you choose for your sink.
    * `YOUR-LOG-DESTINATION` is the URL or IP address of your log management service.
    * `YOUR-LOG-DESTINATION-PORT` is the port number of your log management service.

  <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> <code>enable_tls</code> must be <code>true</code>.</p>

1. Save the YAML file with an appropriate file name. For example, `my-cluster-sink.yml`.

1. Apply the `ClusterLogSink` resource to your cluster by running the following command:

    ```
    kubectl apply -f MY-SINK.yml
    ```
    Where `MY-SINK.yml` is the name of your YAML file.
    For example:
    <pre class='terminal'>
    $ kubectl apply -f my-cluster-sink.yml
    </pre>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Kubectl sink resource names, group names, and api version names have 
  changed in <%= vars.product_short %> v1.5.
</p>

#### <a id='webhook-cluster-sink'></a> Create a Webhook ClusterLogSink Resource with YAML and kubectl

A webhook `ClusterLogSink` resource batches logs into 1 second units, wraps the resulting payload in JSON, and uses the POST method to deliver the logs to the address of your log management service.  

To define a webhook `ClusterLogSink` resource with YAML and `kubectl`, perform the following steps:

1. Create a YAML file that specifies your log destination in the following format:
  
    ```
    apiVersion: pksapi.io/v1beta1
    kind: ClusterLogSink
    metadata:
      name: YOUR-SINK-NAME
    spec:
      type: webhook
      url: YOUR-LOG-DESTINATION
    ```
  Where:
    * `YOUR-SINK-NAME` is a name you choose for your sink.
    * `YOUR-LOG-DESTINATION` is the URL or IP address of your log management service.

1. Save the YAML file with an appropriate filename. For example, `my-cluster-sink.yml`.

1. Apply the `ClusterLogSink` resource to your cluster by running the following command:

    ```
    kubectl apply -f MY-SINK.yml
    ```
    Where `MY-SINK.yml` is the name of your YAML file.
    For example:
    <pre class='terminal'>
    $ kubectl apply -f my-cluster-sink.yml
    </pre>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Kubectl sink resource names, group names, and api version names have 
  changed in <%= vars.product_short %> v1.5.
</p>

### <a id='define-namespace-sink'></a> LogSink Resources

A `LogSink` resource filters logs by namespace within a cluster.

Currently, you can use only `kubectl` to create and manage namespace sinks.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: <%= vars.product_short %> requires a secure connection be used 
for log forwarding. To forward logs using an unsecured connection, see 
<a href="#unsecured-sink-configuration">Unsecured LogSink and ClusterLogSink Log Forwarding</a>, below.<br>
</p>

#### <a id='sink-kubectl'></a> Create a LogSink Resource with YAML and kubectl

To define a `LogSink` resource with YAML and `kubectl`, perform the following steps:

1. Create a YAML file that specifies your log destination in the following format:

    ```
    apiVersion: pksapi.io/v1beta1
    kind: LogSink
    metadata:
      name: YOUR-SINK
      namespace: YOUR-NAMESPACE
    spec:
      type: syslog
      host: YOUR-LOG-DESTINATION
      port: YOUR-LOG-DESTINATION-PORT
      enable_tls: true
    ```
  Where:
    * `YOUR-SINK` is a name you choose for your log sink.
    * `YOUR-NAMESPACE` is the name of your namespace.
    * `YOUR-LOG-DESTINATION` is the URL or IP address of your log management service.
    * `YOUR-LOG-DESTINATION-PORT` is the port number of your log management service.

  <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> <code>enable_tls</code> must be <code>true</code>.</p>
  
1. Save the YAML file with an appropriate file name. For example, `my-namespace-sink.yml`.

1. Apply the `LogSink` resource to your cluster by running the following command:

    ```
    kubectl apply -f MY-SINK.yml
    ```
   Where `MY-SINK.yml` is the name of your YAML file.
   For example:
  <pre class='terminal'>
  $ kubectl apply -f my-namespace-sink.yml
  </pre>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Kubectl sink resource names, group names, and api version names have 
  changed in <%= vars.product_short %> v1.5.
</p>

### <a id='define-metric-sink'></a> ClusterMetricSink Resources

A `ClusterMetricSink` resource collects metrics from a cluster using the [Kubernetes Input Plugin]
(https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/kubernetes) and writes them to one or more outputs
that you specify in the configuration of your `ClusterMetricSink`.
For a list of supported metrics and output plugins,
see [Metrics](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/kubernetes#metrics)
and [Output Plugins](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf#output-plugins) in the telegraf GitHub repository.

Currently, you can use only `kubectl` to create and manage metric sinks for clusters.

#### <a id='default'></a> Create a ClusterMetricSink Resource with YAML and kubectl

To define a `ClusterMetricSink` resource with YAML and `kubectl`, perform the following steps:

1. Create a YAML file in the following format:

    ```
    apiVersion: pksapi.io/v1beta1
    kind: ClusterMetricSink
    metadata:
      name: YOUR-SINK
    spec:
      inputs:
      outputs:
      - type: YOUR-OUTPUT-PLUGIN
    ```
  Where:
    * `YOUR-SINK` is a name you choose for your sink.
    * `YOUR-OUTPUT-PLUGIN` is the name of the output plugin you want to use for your metrics.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> You must leave the <code>inputs</code> field blank.</p>

    For example:

    ```
    apiVersion: pksapi.io/v1beta1
    kind: ClusterMetricSink
    metadata:
      name: http
    spec:
      inputs:
      outputs:
      - type: http
        url: https:example.com
        method: POST
        data_format: json
    ```

1. Save the YAML file with an appropriate filename. For example, `my-cluster-metric-sink.yml`.

1. Apply the `ClusterMetricSink` resource to your cluster by running the following command:

    ```
    kubectl apply -f MY-SINK.yml
    ```
  Where `MY-SINK.yml` is the name of your YAML file.
  For example:
  <pre class='terminal'>
  $ kubectl apply -f my-cluster-metric-sink.yml
  </pre>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Kubectl sink resource names, group names, and api version names have 
  changed in <%= vars.product_short %> v1.5.
</p>

### <a id='unsecured-sink-configuration'></a>Unsecured LogSink and ClusterLogSink Log Forwarding

By default, <%= vars.product_short %> requires a secure connection be used for LogSink and ClusterLogSink log forwarding. 
To forward LogSink and ClusterLogSink logs using an unsecured connection, you must first disable log forwarding validation.  

1. To disable sink forwarding validation, run the following command:    

    ```
    kubectl delete validatingwebhookconfigurations validator.pksapi.io
    ```
<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Disabling the default secured log forwarding requirement is not secure.</p>

## <a id='list-sinks'></a> List Sinks

To list sinks for clusters and namespaces, use the commands in the following sections.

###<a id="cluster-sink-list"></a> ClusterLogSink Resources  

To list log sinks deployed to your cluster, run the following command:

```
pks sinks CLUSTER-NAME
```

Where `CLUSTER-NAME` corresponds to the name of your cluster.

Alternately, you can use `kubectl`:

```
kubectl get clusterlogsinks
``` 

### <a id="sink-list"></a> LogSink Resources

To list namespace log sinks, run the following command:

```
kubectl get logsinks
``` 

### <a id="metric-sink-list"></a> ClusterMetricSink Resources

``` 

Where `CLUSTER-NAME` is the name of your cluster.

To delete a specific log sink, specify the name of the sink you want to delete:

```
pks delete-sink CLUSTER-NAME --name YOUR-SINK
``` 
Where:

* `CLUSTER-NAME` is the name of your cluster.
* `YOUR-SINK` is the name of your sink.

### <a id='clusterlogsink-delete'></a> ClusterLogSink Resources

To delete a ClusterLogSink resource using `kubectl`, run the following command:
