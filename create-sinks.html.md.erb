title: Creating Sink Resources

<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic describes how to create a sink resource for a Kubernetes cluster
provisioned with Pivotal Container Service (PKS) or for a namespace within a
cluster.

Sink resources enable PKS users to configure destinations for
logs transported following the Syslog Protocol defined in
[RFC 5424](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5424).

## <a id='prerequisites'></a>Prerequisites

Before you can create a sink resource for a PKS-provisioned Kubernetes cluster
or a namespace within a cluster,
you must ensure that the **Enable Sink Resources** checkbox is selected in the PKS tile.
Selecting this checkbox enables clusters and namespaces to send logs to sinks.

For more information, see the _Logging_ section of the PKS installation topic
for your IaaS:

* [Installing PKS on vSphere](installing-pks-vsphere.html#syslog)
* [Installing PKS on vSphere with NSX-T Integration](installing-nsx-t.html#syslog)
* [Installing PKS on GCP](installing-pks-gcp.html#syslog)
* [Installing PKS on AWS](installing-pks-aws.html#syslog)

<p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: The commands in this topic require that
you install the Kubernetes Command Line Interface (PKS CLI), <code>kubectl</code>.
For installation instructions, see <a href="installing-kubectl-cli.html">Installing the Kubernetes CLI</a>.</p>

## <a id='define-resource'></a>Define Sink Resources

You can create sinks for clusters and namespaces. A namespace sink filters
logs by namespace within a cluster.

* If you want to create a cluster sink, see
[ClusterSink Resource](#define-cluster-sink).
* If you want to create a namespace sink, see
[Sink Resource](#define-namespace-sink).

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you upgrade to PKS v1.2.1, creating a
ClusterSink fails. This issue occurs only after an upgrade to PKS v1.2.1 and does
not apply to new installations of PKS v1.2.1 or later. For more information, see
the corresponding <a href="https://community.pivotal.io/s/article/clustersink-resource-not-found-after-upgrade">Knowledge Base</a> article.</p>

To define a `ClusterSink` resource, create a YAML file that specifies your log
destination in the following format:

```
apiVersion: apps.pivotal.io/v1beta1
kind: ClusterSink
metadata:
  name: YOUR-SINK
spec:
  type: syslog
  host: YOUR-LOG-DESTINATION
  port: YOUR-LOG-DESTINATION-PORT
  enable_tls: true
```

Where:

* `YOUR-SINK` is a name you choose for your sink.
* `YOUR-LOG-DESTINATION` is the URL of your log management service.
* `YOUR-LOG-DESTINATION-PORT` is the port number of your log management
service.

### <a id='define-namespace-sink'></a>Sink Resource

To define a `Sink` resource, create a YAML file that specifies your log
destination in the following format:

```
apiVersion: apps.pivotal.io/v1beta1
kind: Sink
metadata:
  name: YOUR-SINK
  namespace: YOUR-NAMESPACE
spec:
  type: syslog
  host: YOUR-LOG-DESTINATION
  port: YOUR-LOG-DESTINATION-PORT
  enable_tls: true
```

Where:

* `YOUR-SINK` is a name you choose for your sink.
* `YOUR-NAMESPACE` is the name of your namespace.
* `YOUR-LOG-DESTINATION` is the URL of your log management service.
* `YOUR-LOG-DESTINATION-PORT` is the port number of your log management service.

## <a id='create-resource'></a>Create Sink Resources

To create the `ClusterSink` or `Sink` resource that you defined in the
previous step, run the following command: 

```
kubectl apply -f MY-SINK.yml
```

Where `MY-SINK.yml` is the name of your YAML file.

For example:

<pre class='terminal'>
$ kubectl apply -f example-sink.yml
</pre>

## <a id='manage-sinks'></a>Manage Sinks

To list and delete sinks, use the following commands:

### Cluster Sinks  

* `kubectl get clustersinks`. List the sink resources deployed to your cluster.  
* `kubectl delete clustersink YOUR-SINK`. Delete a sink, where `YOUR-SINK` is the name of your sink.  

### Namespace Sinks  

* `kubectl get sinks`. List the sink resources deployed to a namespace.

* `kubectl delete sink YOUR-SINK`. Delete a sink, where `YOUR-SINK` is the name of your sink.
