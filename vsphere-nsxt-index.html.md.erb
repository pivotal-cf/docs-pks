This topic lists the procedures to follow to install <%= vars.product_short %> on vSphere with NSX-T networking manually, using Ops Manager.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The recommended method for installing <%= vars.product_short %> on vSphere with NSX-T is to use the <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console. For information, see <a href="console-install-vsphere.html">Install on vSphere with the Management Console</a>.</p>

##<a id='step01'></a> Step 1: Prepare to Install <%= vars.product_short %> on vSphere with NSX-T

In preparation for installing <%= vars.product_short %> on vSphere with NSX-T Data Center, review all of the topics in the subsection [Preparing to Install <%= vars.product_short %> on vSphere with NSX-T Data Center](./vsphere-nsxt-index-prepare.html).

##<a id='step02'></a> Step 2: Install and Configure NSX-T Data Center for <%= vars.product_short %>

NSX-T Data Center must be installed and configured before you install <%= vars.product_short %>. 

For instructions, see one of the following:
    <ul><li><a href="./nsxt-3-0-install.html">Installing and Configuring NSX-T Data Center v3.0 for <%= vars.product_short %></a></li>
    <li><a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pks/1-7/nsxt-2-5-installation-steps.html">Installing and Configuring NSX-T Data Center v2.5 for Enterprise PKS</a> in the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.7 documentation.</li><ul><li>Follow the sequence of NSX-T v2.5 installation topics in the v1.7 documentation,
    through <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pks/1-7/nsxt-install-mgmt-lb.html">Provisioning a Load Balancer for the NSX-T Management Cluster</a>.
    Then return here to the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.9 docs and continue with the next step.</li></ul></ul>

##<a id='step03'></a> Step 3: Create the Management Plane for <%= vars.product_short %>

Prepare the vSphere and NSX-T infrastructure for the <%= vars.product_short %> Management Plane where Ops Manager, BOSH Director, <%= vars.product_short %> components, and Harbor Registry are deployed. This includes creating a vSphere resource pool for <%= vars.product_short %> management components, an NSX Tier-1 (T1) Logical Switch, an NSX Tier-1 Logical Router and Port, and NAT rules (if you are using NAT mode). 

For instructions, see [Create Management Plane](./nsxt-3-0-install.html#nsxt30-mgmt-plane) in _Installing and Configuring NSX-T Data Center v3.0 for <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>_.

##<a id='step04'></a> Step 4: Create the Compute Plane for <%= vars.product_short %>

Create vSphere Resource Pools for the Availability Zones where you will deploy Kubernetes clusters. These resource pools map to the AZs you will create when you configure BOSH Director and reference when you install the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile. 

Create IP blocks for the [node networks](./nsxt-prepare-env.html#nodes-ip-block) and the [pod networks](./nsxt-prepare-env.html#pods-ip-block). Typically the initial subnets for both nodes and pods will have a size of 256 (/16).

Create a [Floating IP Pool](./nsxt-prepare-env.html#plan-cidrs) from which to assign routable IP addresses to components. This network provides your load balancing address space for each Kubernetes cluster created by <%= vars.product_short %>. The network also provides IP addresses for Kubernetes API access and Kubernetes exposed services.

For instructions, see [Create IP Blocks and Pool for Compute Plane](./nsxt-3-0-install.html#nsxt30-ip-blocks-pool) in _Installing and Configuring NSX-T Data Center v3.0 for <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>_.

##<a id='step05'></a> Step 5: Deploy Ops Manager for <%= vars.product_short %> with NSX-T

Deploy a supported version of Ops Manager on the NSX-T Management Plane network.

For instructions, see <a href="./vsphere-nsxt-om-deploy.html">Deploying Ops Manager with NSX-T for <%= vars.product_short %></a>.

##<a id='step06'></a> Step 6: Generate the NSX-T Management Cluster Root CA Certificate and Key

Generate the CA Cert for the NSX Manager and import the certificate to NSX Manager.

For instructions, see <a href="./nsxt-3-0-install.html#nsxt30-mgmt-ssl">Generate and Register the NSX-T Management SSL Certificate and Private Key</a>.

##<a id='step07'></a> Step 7: Configure BOSH Director for vSphere with NSX-T

Create BOSH availability zones (AZs) that map to the Management and Compute resource pools in vSphere, and the Management and Control plane networks in NSX-T.

For instructions, see <a href="./vsphere-nsxt-om-config.html">Configuring BOSH Director with NSX-T for <%= vars.product_short %></a>.

##<a id='step08'></a> Step 8: Generate and Register the NSX-T Management Cluster Super User Principal Identity Certificate and Key

Generate the NSX Manager Super User Principal Identity Certificate and register it with the NSX Manager using the NSX API.

For instructions, see <a href="./nsxt-generate-pi-cert.html">Generating and Registering the NSX Manager Superuser Principal Identity Certificate and Key</a>.

##<a id='step09'></a> Step 9: Install <%= vars.product_short %> on vSphere with NSX-T

At this point your NSX-T environment is prepared for <%= vars.product_short %> installation using the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile in Ops Manager. 

For instructions, see <a href="./installing-nsx-t.html">Installing <%= vars.product_short %> on vSphere with NSX-T</a>.

##<a id='step10'></a> Step 10: Install VMware Harbor Registry for <%= vars.product_short %>

The VMware Harbor Registry is recommended for <%= vars.product_short %>. Install Harbor in the NSX Management Plane with other <%= vars.product_short %> components, such as the <%= vars.control_plane %> and <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> database, Ops Manager, and BOSH.

If you are using the [NAT deployment topology](nsxt-topologies.html#topology-nat), create a DNAT rule that maps the private Harbor IP address to a routable IP address from the floating IP pool on the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> management network. See <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/vmware-harbor/integrating-pks.html#create-dnat">Create DNAT Rule</a>.

For instructions, see <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/vmware-harbor/installing.html">Installing VMware Harbor Registry</a>.

##<a id='step11'></a> Step 11: Install the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> and Kubectl CLIs 

See <a href="./installing-cli.html">Installing the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> CLI</a> and <a href="./installing-kubectl-cli.html">Installing the Kubernetes CLI</a>.

##<a id='step12'></a> Step 12: Create Admin Users for <%= vars.product_short %>

See <a href="vsphere-configure-users.html">Setting Up <%= vars.product_short %> Admin Users on vSphere</a>  

##<a id='step13'></a> Step 13: Verify the Installation of <%= vars.product_short %>

Create a Kubernetes cluster using the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> CLI. For instructions, see [Create a Kubernetes Cluster](./create-cluster.html#create).

Deploy a simple workload to the Kubernetes cluster. For instructions, see [Deploy Workloads on vSphere with NSX-T](./deploy-workloads.html#external-lb-nsxt).

##<a id='step14'></a> Step 14: Perform Desired Post-Installation Configurations

After you have installed <%= vars.product_short %> on vSphere with NSX-T, refer to the following subsection for topics describing additional NSX-T configuration options: [Advanced Configurations for <%= vars.product_short %> on vSphere with NSX-T Data Center](./vsphere-nsxt-index-adv.html)

##<a id='step15'></a> Step 15: Create Network Profiles to Customize Cluster Deployments

Network profiles let you provide customized deployment templates for Kubernetes clusters. See [Network Profiles (NSX-T Only)](./network-profiles-index.html) for details.
