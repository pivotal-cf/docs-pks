To configure networking, do the following:

1. Click **Networking**.
<% if current_page.data.windowsclusters == true %>
1. Under **Container Networking Interface**, select:  
    * **NSX-T** for Windows worker based clusters on vSphere with NSX-T.  
    * **Flannel** for Windows worker based clusters on vSphere without NSX-T beta.

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: 
      Antrea is not supported for the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> Windows-worker on vSphere without NSX-T beta feature.</p>
    <%#<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: 
      Flannel has been deprecated. Although you can continue to use Flannel, 
      a future <   %= vars.product_short %   > upgrade will automatically switch Flannel configurations to Antrea.</p>#%>
1. (Optional) Enter values for **Kubernetes Pod Network CIDR Range** and **Kubernetes Service Network CIDR Range**.  
	* For Windows worker-based clusters the **Kubernetes Service Network CIDR Range** setting must be `10.220.0.0/16`.  
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> vSphere on Flannel does not support networking Windows containers.
    </p>
<% else %>
1. Under **Container Networking Interface**, select **Antrea**.
  <img src="images/networking-antrea.png" alt="Networking pane configuration" width="425">

    Antrea is selected as the default Container Networking Interface (CNI). <%= vars.recommended_by %> recommends that you use Antrea
    as your CNI.  
<br>
    For more information about using Antrea as your CNI, see 
    [About Upgrading from the Flannel CNI to the Antrea CNI](understanding-upgrades.html#cni) 
    in _About <%= vars.product_short %> Upgrades_.

1. (Optional) Enter values for **Kubernetes Pod Network CIDR Range** and **Kubernetes Service Network CIDR Range**.
  * Ensure that the CIDR ranges do not overlap and have sufficient space for your deployed services.
  * Ensure that the CIDR range for the **Kubernetes Pod Network CIDR Range** is large enough to accommodate the expected maximum number of pods.
