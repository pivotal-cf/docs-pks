This topic describes how to manage <%= vars.product_full %> after changing a BOSH Director 
or <%= vars.product_short %> service account password.  

## <a id='vcenter-pw-change'></a> Manage Your Service Account Passwords
When you installed <%= vars.product_short %> you created two service accounts:  

* **BOSH/Ops Manager Service Account**: This service account is configured in the BOSH Director tile.  
* **Master Node Service Account**: This service account is configured in the <%= vars.product_short %> tile.  

You must update a tile's copy of a service account password after changing the password on your network.

### <a id='configure-passowrds'></a> Step 1: Update Your Service Account Passwords

To update BOSH Director with a new **BOSH/Ops Manager Service Account** password, perform the following steps:  

1. Access the **Installation Dashboard** in Ops Manager.  
1. Select the BOSH Director tile.  
1. Select your IaaS' **Config** tab.  
1. Click **Change**, the link beneath the IaaS **Password** field, to modify the password.

1. Enter the new service account password.  
1. Click **Save** to save the new password to the BOSH Director tile.  

To update <%= vars.product_short %> with a new **Master Node Service Account** password, perform the following steps:  

1. Access the **Installation Dashboard** in Ops Manager.  
1. Select the <%= vars.product_short %> tile.  
1. Select the **Kubernetes Cloud Provider** tab.  
1. Click **Change**, the link beneath your IaaS' **Master Credentials** field, to modify the password.

1. Enter the new control plane node service account password.  
1. Click **Save** to save the new password to the <%= vars.product_short %> tile.  

### <a id='deploy-tkgi'></a> Step 2: Deploy Your New Service Account Passwords

After updating an Ops Manager tile's service account password you must also deploy the new password. 

To deploy a new password to BOSH Director and <%= vars.product_short %>, perform the following steps:  

1. Access the **Installation Dashboard** in Ops Manager.
1. Click **Review Pending Changes**.
1. In the **Errands** section for <%= vars.product_short %>, select **Update all clusters errand**. 
1. Click **Apply Changes** to update the <%= vars.product_short %> installation with the new password(s).

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The <strong>Update all clusters errand</strong> must be enabled 
to update the Kubernetes cloud provider password stored in Kubernetes clusters.</p>

## <a id='nsx-pw-change'></a> Manage Your NSX Manager Password (vSphere and vSphere with NSX-T only)

If you are on vSphere or vSphere with NSX-T only, you also configured the **NSX Manager Account** and password 
when you installed <%= vars.product_short %>. This service account is configured in the BOSH Director tile.  

After changing the password on your network, you must also update the BOSH Director tile's copy of the **NSX Manager Account** password.

To update the BOSH Director with the new NSX Manager password, perform the following steps:  

1. Access the **Installation Dashboard** in Ops Manager.
1. Select the BOSH Director tile.
1. Select the **vCenter Config** tab.
1. Click **Change**, the link beneath the **NSX Username** field, to modify the password.

1. Enter the new password.
1. Click **Save** to save the changes to the BOSH Director tile. 
1. On the Ops Manager **Installation Dashboard**, select **Review Pending Changes**.
1. Click **Apply Changes**.

### <a id='user-authentication-failure'></a> 'Failed to authenticate user' Error When Cluster Service Account Authenticates

**Symptom**

Your cluster control plane node does not authenticate with your vCenter even though the cluster's `/var/vcap/jobs/kube-controller-manager/config/cloud-provider.ini` 
file includes the correct vCenter credentials.  

You see errors similar to the following in your logs:  

* Service account errors in the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> logs:  

    ```
    error ... Failed to authenticate user ...
    ```

* Authentication errors in the BOSH tasks logs:  

    ```
    WARN -- [req_id ...]: Error running method 'Login'. Failed with message 'Cannot complete login due to an incorrect user name or password.'.
    Rescued Unknown: Cannot complete login due to an incorrect user name or password.. backtrace: /var/vcap/data/packages/vsphere_cpi/.../lib/cloud/vsphere/retryer.rb:13:in `try'
    ```

Additionally, the cluster control plane repeatedly attempts to authenticate with vCenter, degrading the state of the STS service, and your vCenter becomes inaccessible.  


**Solution**

To resolve this issue:  

1. Confirm that the correct credentials are included in your cluster's `/var/vcap/jobs/kube-controller-manager/config/cloud-provider.ini` file. 
If the credentials are incorrect, update the configuration with the valid credentials.  

1. If the configured credentials are correct, review your cluster's actual vCenter authentication credentials:  

    ```
    bosh ssh -d DEPLOYMENT-NAME master/0 "sudo cat /var/vcap/jobs/csi-controller/config/csi-vsphere.conf"  
    ```  
    
    Where `DEPLOYMENT-NAME` is the BOSH deployment name for the cluster that does not authenticate.  

1. If the configured credentials and actual credentials are different, you must upgrade the cluster.
